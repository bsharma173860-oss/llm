THEORIES OF AETHER AND ELECTRICITY.
CHAPTEK I. THE THEORY OF THE AETHER IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.
THE observation of the heavens, which has been pursued continually from the earliest ages, revealed to the ancients the
regularity of the planetary motions, and gave rise to the
conception of a universal order. Modern research, building on
this foundation, has shown how intimate is the connexion
between the different celestial bodies. They are formed of the same kind of matter ; they are similar in origin and history ; and across the vast spaces which divide them they hold
perpetual intercourse. Until the seventeenth century the only influence which was known to be capable of passing from star to star was that of
light. Newton added to this the force of gravity ; and it is now
recognized that the power of communicating across vacuous
regions is possessed also by the electric and magnetic attractions. It is thus erroneous to regard the heavenly bodies as isolated in vacant space; around and between them is an incessant
conveyance and transformation of energy. To the vehicle of this activity the name aetlier has been given.
The aether is the solitary tenant of the universe, save for that infinitesimal fraction of space which is occupied by ordinary
matter. Hence arises a problem which has long engaged
attention, and is not yet completely solved : What relation
subsists between the medium which fills the interstellar void
and the condensations of matter that are scattered throughout
it? B
$5
l ' r The ^Theory of the -Aether
The history of this problem may be traced back continuouslyto the earlier half of the seventeenth century. It first emergedclearly in that reconstruction of ideas regarding the physicaluniverse which was effected by Eene Descartes. Descartes was born in 1596, the son of Joachim Descartes,Counsellor to the Parliament of Brittany. As a young manhefollowed the profession of arms, and served in the campaignsofMaurice of Nassau, and the Emperor ; but his twenty-fourthyear brought a profound mental crisis, apparently not unlikethose which have been recorded of many religious leaders ; andhe resolved to devote himself thenceforward to the studyofphilosophy.
The age which preceded the birth of Descartes, and thatinwhich he lived, were marked by events which greatly alteredthe prevalent conceptions of the world. The discoveryofAmerica, the circumnavigation of the globe by Drake, the over-throw of the Ptolemaic system of astronomy, and the inventionof the telescope, all helped to loosen the old foundations andtomake plain the need for a new structure. It was this thatDescartes set himself to erect. His aim was the most ambitiousthat can be conceived ; it was nothing less than to create fromthe beginning a complete system of human knowledge.
Of such a system the basis must necessarily be metaphysical; and this part of Descartes' work is that by which he is mostwidely known. But his efforts were also largely devoted to themechanical explanation of nature, which indeed he regardedasone of the chief ends of Philosophy.*
The general character of his writings may be illustrated bya comparison with those of his most celebrated contemporary,fBacon clearly defined the end to be sought for, and laid downthe method by which it was to be attained; then, recognizingthat to discover all the laws of nature is a task beyond the* Of the works M'hich bear on our present subject, the Dioptrique and theMe'teores were published at Leyden in 1638, and the Principia Philosophiae atAmsterdam in 1644, six years before the death of its author. t The principal philosophical works of Bacon were written about eighteen yearsbefore those of Descartes.
in the SeventeentJi Century. 3
powers of one man or one generation, he left to posterity the
work of filling in the framework which he had designed.
Descartes, on the other hand, desired to leave as little as possible
for his successors to do ; his was a theory of the universe, worked
out as far as possible in every detail. It is, however, impossible
to derive such a theory inductively unless there are at handsufficient observational data on which to base the induction ; and as such data were not available in the age of Descartes,
he was compelled to deduce phenomena from preconceived
principles and causes, after the fashion of the older philosophers.
To the inherent weakness of this method may be traced the
errors that at last brought his scheme to ruin. The contrast between the systems of Bacon and Descartes is not unlike that between the Eoman republic and the empire of Alexander. In the one case we have a career of aggrandizement
pursued with patience for centuries ; in the other a growth of fungus-like rapidity, a speedy dissolution, and an immenseinfluence long exerted by the disunited fragments. Thegrandeur of Descartes' plan, and the boldness of its execution,
stimulated scientific thought to a degree before unparalleled ; and it was largely from its ruins that later philosophers
constructed those more valid theories which have endured to our own time. Descartes regarded the world as an immense machine,
operating by the motion and pressure of matter. " Give mematter and motion," he cried,
" and I will construct the universe." A peculiarity which distinguished his system from that whichafterwards sprang from its decay was the rejection of all forms
of action at a distance ; he assumed that force cannot be communicated except by actual pressure or impact. By this assumption he was compelled to provide an explicit mechanismin order to account for each of the known forces of nature a
task evidently much more difficult than that which lies before those who are willing to admit action at a distance as anultimate property of matter. Since the sun interacts with the planets, in sending themB 2

light and heat and influencing their motions, it followed fromDescartes' principle that interplanetary space must be a plenum,,occupied by matter imperceptible to the touch but capableofserving as the vehicle of force and light. This conclusioninturn determined the view which he adopted on the all- importantquestion of the nature of matter. Matter, in the Cartesian philosophy, is characterized notbyimpenetrability, or by any quality recognizable by the senses,,but simply by extension ; extension constitutes matter, andmatter constitutes space. The basis of all things is a primitive,,elementary, unique type of matter, boundless in extent andinfinitely divisible. In the process of evolution of the universethree distinct forms of this matter have originated, corresponding respectively to the luminous matter of the sun, thetransparent matter of interplanetary space, and the dense,opaque matter of the earth. " The first is constituted by whathas been scraped off the other particles of matter when theywere rounded ; it moves with so much velocity that whenitmeets other bodies the force of its agitation causes it to bebroken and divided by them into a heap of small particles thatare of such a figure as to fill exactly all the holes and smallinterstices which they find around these bodies. The next typeincludes most of the rest of matter ; its particles are spherical,and are very small compared with the bodies we see on theearth ; but nevertheless they have a finite magnitude, so thatthey can be divided into others yet smaller. There exists inaddition a third type exemplified by some kinds of matternamely, those which, on account of their size and figure, cannotbeso easily moved as the preceding. I will endeavour to show thatall the bodies of the visible world are composed of these threeforms of matter, as of three distinct elements ; in fact, that the sunand the fixed stars are formed of the first of these elements, theinterplanetary spaces of the second, and the earth, with theplanets and comets, of the third. For, seeing that the sun andthe fixed stars emit light, the heavens transmit it, and the earth,the planets, and the comets reflect it, it appears to me that there
in the Seventeenth Century. 5is ground for using these three qualities of luminosity, trans- parence, and opacity, in order to distinguish the three elementsof the visible world.*
According to Descartes' theory, the sun is the centre of animmense vortex formed of the first or subtlest kind of inatter.f The vehicle of light in interplanetary space is matter of thesecond kind or element, composed of a closely packed assemblageof globules whose size is intermediate between that of thevortex-matter and that of ponderable matter. The globules of the second element, and all the matter of the first element, areconstantly straining away from the centres around which theyturn, owing to the centrifugal force of the vortices ;J so that theglobules are pressed in contact with each other, and tend tomove outwards, although they do not actually so move. It is the transmission of this pressure which constitutes light ; theaction of light therefore extends on all sides round the sun andfixed stars, and travels instantaneously to any distance. |j Inthe Dwptrique$ vision is compared to the perception of thepresence of objects which a blind man obtains by the use of hisstick ; the transmission of pressure along the stick from theobject to the hand being analogous to the transmission ofpressure from a luminous object to the eye by the second kindof matter. Descartes supposed the " diversities of colour and light
" tohe due to the different ways in which the matter moves.** Inthe Meteores,^ the various colours are connected with differentrotatory velocities of the globules, the particles winch rotate mostrapidly giving the sensation of red, the slower ones of yellow, andthe slowest of green and blue the order of colours being takenfrom the rainbow.

6 The Theory of the Aether
on periodic time is a curious foreshadowing of one of thegreat discoveries of Newton.
The general explanation of light on these principles wasamplified by a more particular discussion of reflexion andrefraction. The law of reflexion that the angles of incidenceand refraction are equal had been known to the Greeks ; butthe law of refraction that the sines of the angles of incidenceand refraction are to each other in a ratio depending on themedia was now published for the first time.* Descartes gaveit as his own ; but he seems to have been under considerableobligations to Willebrord Snell (b. 1591, d. 1626), Professor ofMathematics at Leyden, who had discovered it experimentally(though not in the form in which Descartes gave it) about1621. Snell did not publish his result, but communicated it inmanuscript to several persons, and Huygens affirms that thismanuscript had been seen by Descartes. Descartes presents the law as a deduction from theory.This, however, he is able to do only by the aid of analogy;. when rays meet ponderable bodies,
" they are liable to bedeflected or stopped in the same way as the motion of a ball ora stone impinging 011 a body
"
; for "
it is easy to believe thatthe action or inclination to move, which I have said mustbetaken for light, ought to follow in this the same lawsasmotion."f Thus he replaces light, whose velocity of propagationhe believes to be always infinite, by a projectile whose velocityvaries from one medium to another. The law of refractionisthen proved as followsJ : Let a ball thrown from A meet at B a cloth CBE, so weakthat the ball is able to break through it and pass beyond, butwith its resultant velocity reduced in some definite proportion,,say 1 : k. Then if BI be a length measured on the refracted rayequal to AB, the projectile will take k times as long todescribe BI as it took to describe AB. But the component* Dioptrique, Discount second. t Jbid., Discows premier.

in the Seventeenth Century. 7of velocity parallel to the cloth must be unaffected by theimpact; and therefore the projection BE of the refracted raymust be k times as long as the projection BC of the incidentI ray. So if i and r denote the angles of incidence and refraction,we have
BE BC
or the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction are in aconstant ratio ; this is the law of refraction. Desiring to include all known phenomena in .his system,Descartes devoted some attention to a class of effects whichwere at that time little thought of, but which were destined toplay a great part in the subsequent development of Physics.
The ancients were acquainted with the curious propertiespossessed by two minerals, amber (riXtKrpov) and magneticiron ore (77 \iOos Mayv?}r/e). The former, when rubbed,attracts light bodies : the latter has the power of attractingiron.The use of the magnet for the purpose of indicating direc- tion at sea does not seem to have been derived from classical antiquity ; but it was certainly known in the time of theCrusades. Indeed, magnetism was one of the few scienceswhich progressed during the Middle Ages ; for in the thirteenthcentury Petrus Peregrinus,* a native of Maricourt in Picardy,made a discovery of fundamental importance.
Taking a natural magnet or lodestone, which had beenrounded into a globular form, he laid it on a needle, and marked* His Epistola was written in 1269.
8 The Theory of the Aether
the line along which the needle set itself. Then laying theneedle on other parts of the stone, he obtained more lines inthe same way. When the entire surface of the stone had beencovered with such lines, their general disposition became evident;they formed circles, which girdled the stone in exactly the sameway as meridians of longitude girdle the earth ; and there weretwo points at opposite ends of the stone through which all thecircles passed, just as all the meridians pass through the Arcticand Antarctic poles of the earth.* Struck by the analogy,Peregrinus proposed to call these two points the poles of themagnet : and he observed that the way in which magnetssetthemselves and attract each other depends solely on the positionof their poles, as if these were the seat of the magnetic power.Such was the origin of those theories of poles and polarizationwhich in later ages have played so great a part in NaturalPhilosophy.
The observations of Peregrinus were greatly extended notlong before the tune of Descartes by William Gilberd or Gilbertf(6. 1540, d. 1603). Gilbert was born at Colchester: afterstudying at Cambridge, he took up medical practice in London,and had the honour of being appointed physician to QueenElizabeth. In 1600 he published a work* on Magnetism andElectricity, with which the modern history of both subjectsbegins.
Of Gilbert's electrical researches we shall speak later : inmagnetism he made the capital discovery of the reason whymagnets set in definite orientations with respect to the earth; which is, that the earth is itself a great magnet, having oneofits poles in high northern and the other in high southernlatitudes. Thus the property of the compass was seen to beincluded in the general principle, that the north-seeking poleof* " Procul dubio oranes lineae hujusmodi in duo puncta concurrent sicut omnesorbes meridian! in duo concurrunt polos mundi oppositos." t The form in the Colchester records is Gilberd.

in the Seventeenth Century. 9every magnet attracts the south-seeking pole of every othermagnet, and repels its north-seeking pole. Descartes attempted* to account for magnetic phenomenaby his theory of vortices. A vortex of fluid matter waspostulated round each magnet, the matter of the vortex enteringby one pole and leaving by the other : this matter was supposedto act on iron and steel by virtue of a special resistance to its motion afforded by the molecules of those substances. Crude though the Cartesian system was in this and manyother features, there is no doubt that by presenting definiteconceptions of molecular activity, and applying them to so widea range of phenomena, it stimulated the spirit of inquiry, andprepared the way for the more accurate theories that came after. In its own day it met with great acceptance: the confusion whichhad resulted from the destruction of the old order was now, asit seemed, ended by a reconstruction of knowledge in a systemat once credible and complete. Nor did its influence quicklywane ; for even at Cambridge it was studied long after Newtonhad published his theory of gravitation ;f and in the middle ofthe eighteenth century Euler and two of the Bernoullis basedthe explanation of magnetism on the hypothesis of vertices.* Descartes' theory of light rapidly displaced the conceptionswhich had held sway in the Middle Ages. The validityof his explanation of refraction was, however, called inquestion by his fellow-countryman Pierre de Ferinat (b. 1601,d. 1665), and a controversy ensued, which was kept upby the Cartesians long after the death of their master. Fermat*

f Winston has recorded that, having returned to Cambridge after his ordination in 1693, he resumed his studies there, "
particularly the Mathematicks, and the Cartesian Philosophy : which was alone in Vogue with us at that Time. But it was not long before I, with immense Pains, but no Assistance, set myself
with the utmost Zeal to the study of Sir Isaac Newton's M-onderful Discoveries."

10 The Theory of the Aether
eventually introduced a new fundamental law, from which heproposed to deduce the paths of rays of light. This was thecelebrated Principle of Least Time, enunciated* in the form," Nature always acts by the shortest course." From it the lawof reflexion can readily be derived, since the path described bylight between a point 011 the incident ray and a point on thereflected ray is the shortest possible consistent with the condition of meeting the reflecting surfaces.t In order to obtain thelaw of refraction, Fermat assumed that " the resistance of themedia is different," and applied his "method of maxima andminima " to find the path which would be described in the leasttime from a point of one medium to a point of the other. In1661 he arrived at the solution.* "The result of my work," hewrites,
" has been the most extraordinary, the most unforeseen,and the happiest, that ever was ; for, after having performed allthe equations, multiplications, antitheses, and other operationsof my method, and having finally finished the problem, I havefound that my principle gives exactly and precisely the sameproportion for the refractions which Monsieur Descartes hasestablished." His surprise was all the greater, as he hadsupposed light to move more slowly in dense than in rare media,whereas Descartes had (as will be evident from the demonstrationgiven above) been obliged to make the contrary supposition.Although Fermat's result was correct, and, indeed, of highpermanent interest, the principles from which it was derivedwere metaphysical rather than physical in character, and con-sequently were of little use for the purpose of framingamechanical explanation of light. Descartes' theory thereforeheld the field until the publication in 1667 of the Micrographics*

Hooke, who was both an observer and a theorist, made twoexperimental discoveries which concern our present subject ; butin both of these, as it appeared, he had been anticipated. Thefirst* was the observation of the iridescent colours which areseen when light falls on a thin layer of air between two glass
plates or lenses, or on a thin film of any transparent substance.These are generally known as the " colours of thin plates," or" Newton's rings
"
; they had been previously observed by Boyle.fHooke's second experimental discovery,^ made after the date of the Micrographia, was that light in air is not propagated exactlyin straight lines, but that there is some illumination within thegeometrical shadow of an opaque body. This observation hadbeen published in 1665 in. a posthumous work of FrancescoMaria Grimaldi (b. 1618, d. 1663), who had given to the phe-nomenon the name diffraction. Hooke's theoretical investigations on light were of greatimportance, representing as they do the transition from theCartesian system to the fully developed theory of undulations.He begins by attacking Descartes' proposition, that light is atendency to motion rather than an actual motion. " There is," he observes,1 1 " no luminous Body but has the parts of it in motion more or less
"
; and this motion is " exceeding quick."Moreover, since some bodies (e.g. the diamond when rubbed orheated in the dark) shine for a considerable time without beingwasted away, it follows that whatever is in motion is not per-manently lost to the body, and therefore that the motion mustbe of a to-and-fro or vibratory character. The amplitude of thevibrations must be exceedingly small, since some luminous bodies(e.g. the diamond again) are very hard, and so cannot yield orbend to any sensible extent.

12 The Theory of the Aether
Concluding, then, that the condition associated with theemission of light by a luminous body is a rapid vibratory motionof very small amplitude, Hooke next inquires how light travelsthrough space.
" The next thing we are to consider," he says,"
is the way or manner of the trajection of this motion throughthe interpos'd pellucid body to the eye : And here it will beeasily granted
" First, that it must be a body susceptible and impartible ofthis motion that will deserve the name of a Transparent ; andnext, that the parts of such a body must be homogeneous, or ofthe same kind.
" Thirdly, that the constitution and motion of the parts mustbe such that the appulse of the luminous body may be communicated or propagated through it to the greatest imaginabledistance in the least imaginable time, though I see no reasontoaffirm that it must be in an instant.
" Fourthly, that the motion is propagated every way throughan Homogeneous medium by direct or straight lines extended everyway like Eays from the centre of a Sphere.
" Fifthly, in an Homogeneous medium this motion is propagated every way with equal velocity, whence necessarily everypulse or vibration of the luminous body will generate a Sphere,which will continually increase, and grow bigger, just after thesame manner (though indefinitely swifter) as the waves or ringson the surface of the water do swell into bigger and biggercircles about a point of it, where by the sinking of a Stone themotion was begun, whence it necessarily follows, that all theparts of these Spheres undulated through an Homogeneous mediumcut the Kays at right angles."
Here we have a fairly definite mechanical conception. Itresembles that of Descartes in postulating a medium as thevehicle of light ; but according to the Cartesian hypothesis thedisturbance is a statical pressure in this medium, whileinHooke's theory it is a rapid vibratory motion of small amplitude.In the above extract Hooke introduces, moreover, the ideaofthe wave-swrface, or locus at any instant of a disturbance gene-
in the Seventeenth Century. 13rated originally at a point, and affirms that it is a sphere,
whose, centre is the point in question, and whose radii are the rays of light issuing from the point.
Hooke's next effort was to produce a mechanical theory of
refraction, to replace that given by Descartes.
" Because," hesays, "all transparent mediums are not Homogeneous to oneanother, therefore we will next examine how this pulse or motionwill be propagated through differingly transparent mediums.And here, according to the most acute and excellent PhilosopherDes Cartes, I suppose the sine of the angle of inclination in thefirst medium to be to the sine of refraction in the second, as thedensity of the first to the density of the second. By density, I mean not the density in respect of gravity (with which therefractions or transparency of mediums hold no proportion), butin respect only to the trajeetion of the Kays of light, in whichrespect they only differ in this, that the one propagates thepulse more easily and weakly, the other more slowly, butmore strongly. But as for the pulses themselves, they will by the refraction acquire another property, which we shall nowendeavour to explicate.
"We will suppose, therefore, in the first Figure, ACFD to bea physical Kay, or ABCand DEFto be two mathematical Kaysr trajected from a very remote point of a luminous body through
14 The Theory of the Aether
an Homogeneous transparent medium LL, and DA, EB, FC, to besmall portions of the orbicular impulses which must thereforecut the Rays at right angles : these Rays meeting with the plainsurface NO of a medium that yields an easier transitus to thepropagation of light, and falling obliquely on it, they will in themedium MM be refracted towards the perpendicular of thesurface. And because this medium is more easily trajected thanthe former by a third, therefore the point of the orbicularpulse FG will be moved to If four spaces in the same time thatF, the other end of it, is moved to three spaces, therefore thewhole refracted pulse to Hshall be oblique to the refracted RaysGHK and /."
Although this is not in all respects successful, it representsa decided advance on the treatment of the same problem byDescartes, which rested on a mere analogy. Hooke tries todetermine what happens to the wave-front when it meetsthe interface between two media ; and for this end he intro-duces the correct principle that the side of the wave-frontwhich first meets the interface will go forward in the secondmedium with the velocity proper to that medium, while theother side of the wave-front which is still in the first mediumis still moving with the old velocity : so that the wave-frontwill be deflected in the transition from one medium to theother.This deflection of the wave-front was supposed by Hooketobe the origin of the prismatic colours. He regarded natural orwhite light as the simplest type of disturbance, being consti-tuted by a simple and uniform pulse at right angles to thedirection of propagation, and inferred that colour is generatedby the distortion to which this disturbance is subjected in theprocess of refraction. "The Ray,"* he says,
"
is dispersed, split, andopened by its Refraction at the Superficies of a second medium,and from a line is opened into a diverging Superficies, andso obliquated, whereby the appearances of Colours are produced."* Hooke, Posthnmo/is Works, p. 82.
in the Seventeenth Century. \ 5
" Colour/' he says in another place,*
"
is nothing but the
disturbance of light by the communication of the pulse to other
transparent mediums, that is by the refraction thereof." His
precise hypothesis regarding the different colours wasf "that
Blue is an impression on the Retina of an oblique and confus'd
pulse of light, whose weakest part precedes, and whosestrongest follows. And, that red is an impression on the Retina
of an oblique and confus'd pulse of light, whose strongest part
precedes, and whose weakest follows." Hooke's theory of colour was completely overthrown, within
a few years of its publication, by one of the earliest discoveries
of Isaac Xewton (b. 1642, d. 1727). Newton, who was elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1667, had in the
beginning of 1666 obtained a triangular prism,
" to try- therewith the celebrated Phaenomena of Colours." For this purpose,
" having darkened my chamber, and made a small hole
in my window-shuts, to let in a convenient quantity of the
Sun's light, I placed my Prisme at his entrance, that it mightbe thereby refracted to the opposite wall. It was at first a very pleasing divertisement, to view the vivid and intense
colours produced thereby ; but after a while applying myself to consider them more circumspectly, I became surprised to see them in an oblong form, which, according to the received laws
of Refraction, I expected should have been circular" Thelength of the coloured spectrum was in fact about five times as great as its breadth.
This puzzling fact he set himself to study ; and after moreexperiments the true explanation was discovered namely,
that ordinary white light is really a mixture of rays of every
variety of colour, and that the elongation of the spectrum is due to the differences in the refractive power of the glass for these different rays.
" Amidst these thoughts," he tells us,+

; this was in 1666, andhis memoir on the subject was not presented to the KoyalSociety until five years later. In it he propounds a theoryofcolour directly opposed to that of Hooke. " Colours," he says,"are not Qualifications of light derived from Refractions, orReflections of natural Bodies (as 'tis generally believed), butOriginal and connate properties, which in divers Rays are divers.Some Rays are disposed to exhibit a red colour and no other: some a yellow and no other, some a green and no other, andsoof the rest. Nor are there only Rays proper and particular tothe more eminent colours, but even to all their intermediategradations.
" To the same degree of Refrangibility ever belongs thesame colour, and to the same colour ever belongs the samedegree of Refrangibility."
" The species of colour, and degree of Refrangibility properto any particular sort of Rays, is not mutable by Refraction, norby Reflection from natural bodies, nor
by, any other cause, thatI could yet observe. When any one sort of Rays hath beenwell parted from those of other kinds, it hath afterwardsobstinately retained its colour, notwithstanding my utmostendeavours to change it." The publication of the new theory gave rise to an acutecontroversy. As might have been expected, Hooke was foremostamong the opponents, and led the attack with some degreeofasperity. When it is remembered that at this time Newtonwas at the outset of his career, while Hooke was an older man,with an established reputation, such harshness appears particularly ungenerous; and it is likely that the unpleasantconsequences which followed the announcement of his firstgreat discovery had much to do with the reluctance whichNewton ever afterwards showed to publish his results to theworld.
In the course of the discussion Newton found occasion toexplain more fully the views which he entertained regardingthe nature of light. Hooke charged him with holding the
in the Seventeenth Century. 17doctrine that light is a material substance. Now Newton had, as a matter of fact, a great dislike of the more imaginative kind of hypotheses ; he altogether renounced the attempt to construct the universe from its foundations after the fashion of Descartes,
and aspired to nothing more than a formulation of the lawswhich directly govern the actual phenomena. His theory of
gravitation, for example, is strictly an expression of the results
of observation, and involves no hypothesis as to the cause of theattraction which subsists between ponderable bodies ; and his own desire in regard to optics was to present a theory free fromspeculation as to the hidden mechanism of light. Accordingly,in reply to Hooke's criticism, he protested* that his views oncolour were in no way bound up with any particular conceptionof the ultimate nature of optical processes. Xewton was, however, unable to carry out his plan of connecting together the phenomena of light into a coherentand reasoned whole without having recourse to hypotheses. Thehypothesis of Hooke, that light consists in vibrations of anaether, he rejected for reasons which at that time were perfectly
cogent, and which indeed were not successfully refuted for overa century. One of these was the incompetence of the wavetheory to account for the rectilinear propagation of light, andanother was its inability to embrace the facts discovered, as we shall presently see, by Huygens, and first interpretedcorrectly by Newton himself of polarization. On the whole,he seems to have favoured a scheme of which the following maybe taken as a summaryf : All space is permeated by an elastic medium or aether, whichis capable of propagating vibrations in the same way as the*Phil.

in Horsley's Newtoni Opera, p. 385. In the Principia, Book I., section xiv, the analogy between rays of light and
streams of corpuscles is indicated ; but Newton does not commit himself to any
theory of light based on this. C
18 The Theory of the Aether
air propagates the vibrations of sound, but with far greatervelocity.
This aether pervades the pores of all material bodies, andis the cause of their cohesion ; its density varies from one bodyto another, being greatest in the free interplanetary spaces. Itis not necessarily a single uniform substance : but just as aircontains aqueous vapour, so the aether may contain various" aethereal spirits," adapted to produce the phenomenaofelectricity, magnetism, and gravitation.
The vibrations of the aether cannot, for the reasons alreadymentioned, be supposed in themselves to constitute light.Light is therefore taken to be " something of a different kind,propagated from lucid bodies. They, that will, may supposeit an aggregate of various peripatetic qualities. Others maysuppose it multitudes of unimaginable small and swiftcorpuscles of various sizes, springing from shining bodiesat great distances one after another; but yet without anysensible interval of time, and continually urged forward byaprinciple of motion, which in the beginning accelerates them,till the resistance of the aethereal medium equals the force ofthat principle, much after the manner that bodies let fall inwater are accelerated till the resistance of the water equals theforce of gravity. But they, that like not this, may supposelight any other corporeal emanation, or any impulse or motionof any other medium or aethereal spirit diffused through themain body of aether, or what else they can imagine proper forthis purpose. To avoid dispute, and make this hypothesisgeneral, let every man here take his fancy ; only whateverlight be, I suppose it consists of rays differing from one anotherin contingent circumstances, as bigness, form, or vigour."*
In any case, light and aether are capable of mutual inter-action; aether is in fact the intermediary between light andponderable matter. When a ray of light meets a stratumofaether denser or rarer than that through which it has latelybeen passing, it is, in general, deflected from its rectilinear* Royal Society, Dec. 9, 1675.
in the Seventeenth Century. 19course ; and differences of density of the aether between onematerial medium and another account on these principles for the reflexion and refraction of light. The condensation or
rarefaction of the aether due to a material body extends to some little distance from the surface of the body, so that theinflexion due to it is really continuous, and not abrupt; andthis further explains diffraction, which Newton took to be" only a new kind of refraction, caused, perhaps, by theexternal aethers beginning to grow rarer a little before it came at the opake body, than it was in free spaces."
Although the regular vibrations of Newton's aether were notsupposed to constitute light, its irregular turbulence seems tohave represented fairly closely his conception of heat. Hesupposed that when light is absorbed by a material body,vibrations are set up in the aether, and are recognizable asthe heat which is always generated in such cases. Theconduction of heat from hot bodies to contiguous cold ones heconceived to be effected by vibrations of the aether propagatedbetween them ; and he supposed that it is the violent agitationof aethereal motions which excites incandescent substances toemit light.
Assuming with Newton that light is not actually constituted by the vibrations of an aether, even though suchvibrations may exist in close connexion with it, the mostdefinite and easily conceived supposition is that rays of lightare streams of corpuscles emitted by luminous bodies. Althoughthis was not the hypothesis of Descartes himself, it was sothoroughly akin to his general scheme that the scientific menof Newton's generation, who were for the most part deeplyimbued with the Cartesian philosophy, instinctively selectedit from the wide choice of hypotheses which Newton had offeredthem ; and by later writers it was generally associated withNewton's name. A curious argument in its favour was drawnfrom a phenomenon which had then been known for nearly halfa century : Vincenzo Cascariolo, a shoemaker of Bologna, haddiscovered, about 1630, that a substance, which afterwardsC 2
20 The Theory of the Aether
received the name of Bologna stone or Bologna phosphorus, has-the property of shining in the dark after it has been exposedfor some time to sunlight ; and the storage of light whichseemed to be here involved was more easily explicable on thecorpuscular theory than on any other. The evidence inthis quarter, however, pointed the other way when it wasfound that phosphorescent substances do not necessarily emitthe same kind of light as that which was used to stimulatethem.
In accordance with his earliest discovery, Newton consideredcolour to be an inherent characteristic of light, and inferredthat it must be associated with some definite quality of thecorpuscles or aether-vibrations. The corpuscles correspondingto different colours would, he remarked, like sonorous bodies ofdifferent pitch, excite vibrations of different types in theaether ; and "
if by any means those [aether- vibrations] ofunequal bignesses be separated from one another, the largestbeget a Sensation of a Red colour, the least or shortest of adeep Violet, and the intermediate ones, of intermediate colours; much after the manner that bodies, according to their severalsizes, shapes, and motions, excite vibrations in the Air of variousbignesses, which, according to those bignesses, make severalTones in Sound."*
This sentence is the first enunciation of the great principlethat homogeneous light is essentially periodic in its nature, andthat differences of period correspond to differences of colour.The analogy with Sound is obvious ; and it may be remarkedin passing that Newton's theory of periodic vibrations in anelastic medium, which he developed! in connexion with theexplanation of Sound, would alone entitle him to a place amongthose who have exercised the greatest influence on the theoryof light, even if he had made no direct contribution to thelatter subject.

in the Seventeenth Century. 21Newton devoted considerable attention to the colours of thin, plates, and determined the empirical laws of thephenomena with great accuracy. In order to explain them, hesupposed that " every ray of light, in its passage through anyrefracting surface, is put into a certain transient constitution orstate, which, in the progress of the ray, returns at equalintervals, and disposes the ray, at every return, to be easily
transmitted through the next refracting surface, and, betweenthe returns, to be easily reflected by it."* The intervalbetween two consecutive dispositions to easy transmission, or" length of fit," he supposed to depend on the colour, beinggreatest for red light and least for violet. If then a ray of homogeneous light falls on a thin plate, its fortunes as regardstransmission and reflexion at the two surfaces will depend onthe relation which the length of fit bears to the thickness ofthe plate ; and on this basis he built up a theory of the coloursof thin plates. It is evident that Newton's "length of fit"corresponds in some measure to the quantity which in theundulatory theory is called the wave-length of the light ; butthe suppositions of easy transmission and reflexion were soonfound inadequate to explain all Newton's experimental results
.at least without making other and more complicated additionalassumptions.
At the time of the publication of Hooke's Micrographia, andNewton's theory of colours, it was not known whether lightis propagated instantaneously or not. An attempt to settlethe question experimentally had been made many yearspreviously by Galileo,f who had stationed two men withlanterns at a considerable distance from each other ; one ofthem was directed to observe when the other uncovered hislight, and exhibit his own the moment he perceived it. Butthe interval of time required by the light for its journey wastoo small to be perceived in this way ; and the discovery was*

22 The Theory of the Aether
ultimately made by an astronomer. It was observed in 1675by Olof Roemer* (b. 1644, d. 1710) that the eclipses of the firstsatellites of Jupiter were apparently affected by an unknowndisturbing cause ; the time of the occurrence of the phenomenonwas retarded when the earth and Jupiter, in the course of theirorbital motions, happened to be most remote from each other,and accelerated in the contrary case. Eoemer explained thisby supposing that light requires a finite time for its propagation from the satellite to the earth ; and by observations ofeclipses, he calculated the interval required for its passage fromthe sun to the earth (the light-equation, as it is called) to be11 minutes,f
Shortly after Roemer's discovery, the wave-theory of lightwas greatly improved and extended by Christiaan Huygens(b. 1629, d. 1695). Huygens, who at the time was living inParis, communicated his results in 1678 to Cassini, Eoemer,De la Hire, and the other physicists of the French Academy,and prepared a manuscript of considerable length on the subject.This he proposed to translate into Latin, and to publish in thatlanguage together with a treatise on the Optics of Telescopes; but the work of translation making little progress, after a delayof twelve years, he decided to print the work on wave-theoryin its original form. In 1690 it appeared at Leyden,J underthe title Traite de la lumiere ou sont expliquees les causes de cequi luy arrive dans la reflexion et dans la refraction. Et parti-*Mem. de 1'Acad. x. (1666-1699), p. 575. t It was soon recognized that Roemer's value was too large ; and theastronomers of the succeeding half-century reduced it to 7 minutes. Delambre,by an investigation whose details appear to have been completely destroyed,published in 1817 the value 493 -2 s
, from a discussion of eclipses of Jupiter'ssatellites during the previous 150 years. Glasenapp, in an inaugural dissertationpublished in 1875, discussed the eclipses of the first satellite between 1848 and1870, and derived, by different assumptions, values between 496s and 501s
, themost probable value being 500-88
. Sampson, in 1909, derived 498'64S from hisown readings of the Harvard Observations, and 498'79S from the Harvard readings,with probable errors of about + 0'02". The inequalities of Jupiter's surface giverise to some difficulty in exact determinations.

The truth of Hooke's hypothesis, that light is essentially aform of motion, seemed to Huygens to be proved ]}y the effects observed with burning-glasses ; for in the combustion induced atthe focus of the glass, the molecules of bodies are dissociated ; which, as he remarked, must be taken as a certain sign of motion,if, in conformity to the Cartesian philosophy, we seek the causeof all natural phenomena in purely mechanical actions. The question then arises as to whether the motion is thatof a medium, as is supposed in Hooke's theory, or whether it may be compared rather to that of a flight of arrows, as in thecorpuscular theory. Huygens decided that the former alter- native is the only tenable one, since beams of light proceedingin directions inclined to each other do not interfere with eachother in any way.
Moreover, it had previously been shown by Torricelli thatlight is transmitted as readily through a vacuum as throughair ; and from this Huygens inferred that the medium or aetherin which the propagation takes place must penetrate all matter,and be present even in all so-called vacua. The process of wave-propagation he discussed by aid of aprinciple which was nowf introduced for the first time, and hassince been generally known by his name. It may be stated thus : Consider a wave-front,* or locus of disturbance, as it exists at a definite instant t : then each surface-element of thewave-front may be regarded as the source of a secondary wave,which in a homogeneous isotropic medium will be propagatedoutwards from the surface-element in the form of a spherewhose radius at any subsequent instant t is proportional to(t-t ) ; and the wave-front which represents the whole distur-

pulses "; Huygens never considered true wave-trains having the property of periodicity.
24 The Theory of the Aether
bance at the instant t is simply the envelope of the secondarywaves which arise from the various surface elements of theoriginal wave-front.* The introduction of this principle enabledHuygens to succeed where Hooke and other contemporarywave-theoristsf had failed, in achieving the explanation ofrefraction and reflexion. His method was to combine his ownprinciple with Hooke's device of following separately the fortunesof the right-hand and left-hand sides of a wave-front whenitreaches the interface between two media. The actual explanation for the case of reflexion is as follows : Let AB represent the interface at which reflexion takesplace, AHC the incident wave-front at an instant , GMBtheposition which the wave-front would occupy at a later instanttif the propagation were not interrupted by reflexion. Thenby"G Huygens' principle the secondary wave from A is at the instantt a sphere ENS of radius equal to AG : the disturbance fromHt after meeting the interface at K, will generate a secondarywave TV oi radius equal to KM, and similarly the secondarywave corresponding to any other element of the original wave-* The justification for this was given long afterwards by Fresnel, Annales dechimie, xxi. t e.g. Ignace Gaston Pardies and Pierre Ango, the latter of whom publisheda work on Optics at Paris'in 1682.
in the Seventeenth Century. 25front can be found. It is obvious that the envelope of these
secondary waves, which constitutes the final wave-front, will bea plane BN, which will be inclined to AB at the same angle as AC. This gives the law of reflexion. The law of refraction is established by similar reasoning, on the supposition that the velocity of light depends on the
medium in which it is propagated. Since a ray which passes from air to glass is bent inwards towards the normal, it may beinferred that light travels more slowly in glass than in air. Huygens offered a physical explanation of the variation in
velocity of light from one medium to another, by supposingthat transparent bodies consist of hard particles which interact with the aethereal matter, modifying its elasticity. Theopacity of metals he explained by an extension of the sameidea, supposing that some of the particles of metals are hard(these account for reflexion) and the rest soft : the latter destroy
the luminous motion by damping it. The second half of the Theorie de la lumiere is concerned witha phenomenon which had been discovered a few years pre- viously by a Danish philosopher, Erasmus Bartholin (b. 1625,
d. 1698). A sailor had brought from Iceland to Copenhagen a number of beautiful crystals which he had collected in the Bayof Eoerford. Bartholin, into whose hands they passed, noticed*
that any small object viewed through one of these crystals
appeared double, and found the immediate cause of this in the
fact that a ray of light entering the crystal gave rise in general
to two refracted rays. One of these rays was subject to the
ordinary law of refraction, while the other, which was called the extraordinary ray, obeyed a different law, which Bartholin
did not succeed in determining.
The matter had arrived at this stage when it was taken upby Huygens. Since in his conception each ray of light corresponds
to the propagation of a wave-front, the two rays in Iceland
spar must correspond to two different wave-fronts propagated
*

26 The Theory of the Aether
simultaneously. In this idea he found no difficulty ; as he says:" It is certain that a space occupied by more than one kindofmatter may permit the propagation of several kinds of waves,different in velocity; for this actually happens in air mixedwith aethereal matter, where sound-waves and light-wavesarepropagated together."
Accordingly he supposed that a light-disturbance generatedat any spot within a crystal of Iceland spar spreads out in theform of a wave-surface, composed of a sphere and a spheroidhaving the origin of disturbance as centre. The spherical wavefront corresponds to the ordinary ray, and the spheroid to theextraordinary ray ; and the direction in which the extraordinaryray is refracted may be determined by a geometrical construction, in which the spheroid takes the place which in theordinary construction is taken by the sphere.
Thus, let the plane of the figure be at right angles to theintersection of the wave-front with the surface of the crystal; let AB represent the trace of the incident wave-front ; andsuppose that in unit time the disturbance from B reaches theinterface at T. In this unit-interval of time the disturbancefrom A will have spread out within the crystal into a sphereand spheroid : so the wave-front corresponding to theordinary ray will be the tangent-plane to the sphere throughthe line whose trace is T, while the wave-front correspondingto the extraordinary ray will be the tangent-plane to thespheroid through the same line. The points of contactN

Huygens did not in the Thtoi-ie de la lumiere attempt a detailed physical explanation of the spheroidal wave, but communicatedone later in a letter to Papin,f written in December, 1690. " Asto the kinds of matter contained in Iceland crystal," he says,
" I suppose one composed of small spheroids, and another whichoccupies the interspaces around these spheroids, and which serves
to bind them together. Besides these, there is the matter of aether permeating all the crystal, both between and within the
parcels of the two kinds of matter just mentioned ; for I suppose
both the little spheroids, and the matter which occupies the
intervals around them, to be composed of small fixed particles,
amongst which are diffused in perpetual motion the still finer particles of the aether. There is now no reason why the
ordinary ray in the crystal should not be due to waves propagated in this aethereal matter. To account for the extraordinary
refraction, I conceive another kind of waves, which have for vehicle both the aethereal matter and the two other kinds of matter constituting the crystal. Of these latter, I suppose that
the matter of the small spheroids transmits the waves a little more quickly than the aethereal matter, while that around the
spheroids transmits these waves a little more slowly than the same aethereal matter. . . . These same waves, when they travel in the direction of the breadth of the spheroids, meet with more of the matter of the spheroids, or at least pass with less obstruction, and so are propagated a little more quickly in this sense than in the other ; thus the light-disturbance is propagated
as a spheroidal sheet." Huygens made another discoveryj of capital importance when* The word ray in the wave-theory is always applied to the line which goes from the centre of a wave (i.e. the origin of the disturbnnce) to a point on its surface, whatever may be the inclination of this line to the surface-element on which it abuts; for this line has the optical properties of the "rays" of the
emission theory.

experimenting with the Iceland crystal. He observed that thetwo rays which are obtained by the double refraction of a singleray afterwards behave in a way different from ordinary lightwhich has not experienced double refraction ; and in particular,if one of these rays is incident on a second crystal of Icelandspar, it gives rise in some circumstances to two, and in othersto only one, refracted ray. The behaviour of the ray at thissecond refraction can be altered by simply rotating the secondcrystal about the direction of the ray as axis ; the ray undergoing the ordinary or extraordinary refraction according as theprincipal section of the crystal is in a certain direction or in thedirection at right angles to this. The first stage in the explanation of Huygens' observationwas reached by Newton, who in 1717 showed* that a rayobtained by double refraction differs from a ray of ordinarylight in the same way that a long rod whose cross-section isarectangle differs from a long rod whose cross-section is a circle: in other words, the properties of a ray of ordinary light are thesame with respect to all directions at right angles to its directionof propagation, whereas a ray obtained by double refractionmust be supposed to have sides, or properties related to specialdirections at right angles to its own direction. The refractionof such a ray at the surface of a crystal depends on the relationof its sides to the principal plane of the crystal.
That a ray of light should possess such properties seemedtoNewtonf an insuperable objection to the hypothesis whichregarded waves of light as analogous to waves of sound. Onthis point he was in the right : his objections are perfectlyvalid against the wave-theory as it was understood byhiscontemporariesJ, although not against the theory which wasputforward a century later by Young and Fresnel.

CHAPTEE II. ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC SCIENCE PRIOR TO THE INTRODUCTION
OF THE POTENTIALS. THE magnetic discoveries of Peregrinus and Gilbert, and the
vortex-hypothesis by which Descartes had attempted to explain
them,* had raised magnetism to the rank of a separate science
by the middle of the seventeenth century. The kindred science
of electricity was at that time in a less developed state ; but it had been considerably advanced by Gilbert, whose researches in
this direction will now be noticed. For two thousand years the attractive power of amber had
been regarded as a virtue peculiar to that substance, or possessed
by at most one or two others. Gilbert provedf this view to be
mistaken, showing that the same effects are induced by friction in quite a large class of bodies ; among which he mentioned
glass, sulphur, sealing-wax, and various precious stones. A force which was manifested by so many different kinds of matter seemed to need a name of its own; and accordingly
Gilbert gave to it the name electric, which it has ever since
retained. Between the magnetic and electric forces Gilbert remarked
many distinctions. The lodestone requires no stimulus of friction such as is needed to stir glass and sulphur into activity.
The lodestone attracts only magnetizable substances, whereas
electrified bodies attract everything. The magnetic attraction between two bodies is not affected by interposing a sheet of paper, or a linen cloth, or by immersing the bodies in water j whereas the electric attraction is readily destroyed by screens. Lastly, the magnetic force tends to arrange bodies in definite

30 Electric and Magnetic Science
orientations ; while the electric force merely tends to heapthemtogether in shapeless clusters. These facts appeared to Gilbert to indicate that electricphenomena are due to something of a material nature, whichunder the influence of friction is liberated from the glassoramber in which under ordinary circumstances it is imprisoned.In support of this view he adduced evidence from other quarters.Being a physician, he was well acquainted with the doctrinethat the human body contains various humours or kindsofmoisture phlegm, blood, choler, and melancholy, which,asthey predominated, were supposed to determine the temperofmind; and when he observed that electrifiable bodies werealmost all hard and transparent, and therefore (according totheideas of that time) formed by the consolidation of watery liquids,he concluded that the common menstruum of these liquids mustbe a particular kind of humour, to the possession of whichtheelectrical properties of bodies were to be referred. Frictionmight be supposed to warm or otherwise excite or liberatethehumour, which would then issue from the body as an effluviumand form an atmosphere around it. The effluvium must,heremarked, be very attenuated, for its emission cannot be detectedby the senses. The existence of an atmosphere of effluvia round everyelectrified body might indeed have been inferred, accordingtoGilbert's ideas, from the single fact of electric attraction. Forhe believed that matter cannot act where it is not ; and henceif a body acts on all surrounding objects without appearingtotouch them, something must have proceeded out of it unseen.The whole phenomenon appeared to him to be analogoustothe attraction which is exercised by the earth on falling bodies.For in the latter case he conceived of the atmospheric air astheeffluvium by which the earth draws all things downwardstoitself.Gilbert's theory of electrical emanations commendeditselfgenerally to such of the natural philosophers of the seventeenthcentury as were interested in the subject ; among whomwere

numbered Niccolo Cabeo (b. 1585, d. 1650), an Italian Jesuit
who was. perhaps the first to observe that electrified bodies repel
as well as attract ; the English royalist exile, Sir KenelmDigby (b. 1603, d. 1665); and the celebrated Robert Boyle
(b. 1627, d. 1691). There were, however, some differences of opinion as to the manner in which the effluvia acted on the small
bodies and set them in motion towards the excited electric;
Gilbert himself had supposed the emanations to have an inherent
tendency to reunion with the parent body ; Digby likened their return to the condensation of a vapour by cooling ; and other
writers pictured the effluvia as forming vortices round the
attracted bodies in the Cartesian fashion. There is a well-known allusion to Gilbert's hypothesis in Newton's Opticks.*
" Let him also tell me, how an electrick body can by friction emit an exhalation so rare and subtle,t and yet so potent, as byits emission to cause no sensible diminution of the weight of the
electrick body, and to be expanded through a sphere, whose
diameter is above two feet, and yet to be able to agitate andcarry up leaf copper, or leaf gold, at a distance of above a foot from the electrick body ? " It is, perhaps, somewhat surprising that the Newtoniandoctrine of gravitation should not have proved a severe blow to the emanation theory of electricity ; but Gilbert's doctrine wasnow so firmly established as to be unshaken by the overthrow
of the analogy by which it had been originally justified. It was, however, modified in one particular about the beginning of the
eighteenth century. In order to account for the fact that
electrics are not perceptibly wasted away by excitement, the
earlier writers had supposed all the emanations to return
ultimately to the body which had emitted them ; but the
corpuscular theory of light accustomed philosophers to the
idea of emissions so subtle as to cause no perceptible loss ; and* Query 22. t "
Subtlety," says Johnson, " which in its original import means exility of
particles, is taken in its metaphorical meaning for nicety of distinction."
32 Electric and Magnetic Science
after the time of Newton the doctrine of the return of the-electric effluvia gradually lost credit. Newton died in 1727. Of the expositions of his philosophywhich were published in his lifetime by his followers, oneatleast deserves to be noticed for the sake of the insight whichit affords into the state of opinion regarding light, heat, andelectricity in the first half of the eighteenth century. This wasthe Physices elementa matlwmatica experimentis confirmataofWilhelm Jacob s'Gravesande (b. 1688, d. 1742), publishedatLeyden in 1720. The Latin edition was afterwards reprintedseveral times, and was, moreover, translated into FrenchandEnglish : it seems to have exercised a considerable and, onthewhole, well-deserved influence on contemporary thought.
s'Gravesande supposed light to consist in the projectionofcorpuscles from luminous bodies to [the eye ; the motion beingvery swift, as is shown by astronomical observations. Sincemany bodies, e.g. the metals, become luminous when they--areheated, he inferred that every substance possesses a naturalstore of corpuscles, which are expelled when it is heatedtoincandescence ; conversely, corpuscles may become united toamaterial body ; as happens, for instance, when the body is exposedto the rays of a fire. Moreover, since the heat thus acquiredisreadily conducted throughout the substance of the body,heconcluded that corpuscles can penetrate all substances, howeverhard and dense they be. Let us here recall the ideas then current regardingthenature of material bodies. From the time of Boyle (1626-1691)it had been recognized generally that substances perceptibletothe senses may be either elements or compounds or mixtures;the compounds being chemical individuals, distinct from meremixtures of elements. But the substances at that time acceptedas elements were very different from those which are now knownby the name. Air and the calces* of the metals figured in thelist, while almost all the chemical elements now recognized were
prior to the Introduction oj the Potentials. 33omitted from it ; some of them, such as oxygen and hydrogen,because they were as yet undiscovered, and others, such as themetals, because they were believed to be compounds.
Among the chemical elements, it became customary after the time of Newton to include light-corpuscles.* That something which is confessedly imponderable should ever have beenadmitted into this class may at first sight seem surprising. Butit must be remembered that questions of ponderability countedfor very little with the philosophers of the period. Threequarters of the eighteenth century had passed before Lavoisierenunciated the fundamental doctrine that the total weight of the substances concerned in a chemical reaction is the sameafter the reaction as before it. As soon as this principle cameto be universally applied, light parted company from the trueelements in the scheme of chemistry.
We must now consider the views which were held at this time regarding the nature of heat. These are of interest for ourpresent purpose, on account of the analogies which were set upbetween heat and electricity.
The various conceptions which have been entertainedconcerning heat fall into one or other of two classes, according as heat is represented as a mere condition producible in bodies, oras a distinct species of matter. The former view, which is thatuniversally held at the present day, was advocated by the greatphilosophers of the seventeenth century. Bacon maintained it in the Novum Organum : " Calor," he wrote,
" est niotus expansivus,cohibitus, et nitens per partes minores."f Boyle+ affirmed thatthe " Nature of Heat " consists in " a various, vehement, andintestine commotion of the Parts among themselves." Hookedeclared that " Heat is a property of a body arising from themotion or agitation of its parts." And Newton|| asked : " Do not* Newton himself (Oplicks, p. 349) suspected that light-corpuscles and
ponderable matter might be transmuted into each other : much later, Boscovich
(Theoria, pp. 215, 217) regarded the matter of light as a principle or element in the constitution of natural bodies. t Nov. Org., Lib. n., Aphor. xx. J Mechanical Production of Heat and Cold. Micrographia, p. 37. || Opticks. D
34 Electric and Magnetic Science
all fixed Bodies, when heated beyond a certain Degree, emitlight and shine ; and is not this Emission performed by thevibrating Motion of their Parts ? "
and, moreover, suggested theconverse of this, namely, that when light is absorbed byamaterial body, vibrations are set up which are perceived by thesenses as heat. The doctrine that heat is a material substance was maintained in Newton's lifetime by a certain school of chemists. Themost conspicuous member of the school was Wilhelm Homberg(b. 1652, d. 1715) of Paris, who* identified heat and light with thesulphureous principle, which he supposed to be one of the primaryingredients of all bodies, and to be present even in the inter-planetary spaces. Between this view and that of Newtonitmight at first seem as if nothing but sharp opposition was to beexpected,j- But a few years later the professed exponents of thePrincipia and the Opticks began to develop their system underthe evident influence of Homberg's writings. This evolutionmay easily be traced in s'Gravesande, whose starting-point isthe admittedly Newtonian idea that heat bears to light arelation similar to that which a state of turmoil bears to regularrectilinear motion ; whence, conceiving light as a projection ofcorpuscles, he infers that in a hot body the material particlesand the light-corpusclesj are in a state of agitation, whichbecomes more violent as the body is more intensely heated. s'Gravesande thus holds a position between the two oppositecamps. On the one hand he interprets heat as a modeofmotion ; but on the other he associates it with the presence ofa particular kind of matter, which he further identifies with thematter of light. After this the materialistic hypothesis made* Mem. del'Acad., 1705, p. 88. t Though it reminds us of a curious conjecture ofNewtoa'i: "Is not thestrength and vigour of the action between light and sulphureous bodies one reasonM-liy sulphureous bodies take fire more readily and burn more vehemently thanother bodies do? "
J
I have thought it best to translate s'Gravesande's ignis by "
light-corpuscles."This is, I think, fully justified by such of his statements as Quando ignis perlineas rectas oculos nostros intrat, ex motu gttein fibris in fundo oculi cont/tninicaiideam luminis excitat.
prior to the Introduction of the Potentials. 35rapid progress. It was frankly advocated by another memberof the Dutch school, Hermann Boerhaave* (6. 1668, d. 1738),Professor in the University of Leyden, whose treatise onchemistry was translated into English in 1727.
Somewhat later it was found that the heating effects of therays from incandescent bodies may be separated from theirluminous effects by passing the rays through a plate of glass,which transmits the light, but absorbs the heat. After thisdiscovery it was no longer possible to identify the matter of heatwith the corpuscles of light ; and the former was consequentlyaccepted as a distinct element, under the name of caloric.^ Inthe latter part of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenthcenturies} caloric was generally conceived as occupying theinterstices between the particles of ponderable matter an ideawhich fitted in well with the observation that bodies commonlyexpand when they are absorbing heat, but which was less competent to explain the fact that water expands when freezing.The latter difficulty was overcome by supposing the unionbetween a body and the caloric absorbed in the process ofmelting to be of a chemical nature; so that the consequentchanges in volume would be beyond the possibility of prediction.As we have already remarked, the imponderability of heatdid not appear to the philosophers of the eighteenth century tobe a sufficient reason for excluding it from the list of chemicalelements ; and in any case there was considerable doubt as towhether caloric was ponderable or not. Some experimentersbelieved that bodies were heavier when cold than when hot;others that they were heavier when hot than when cold. Thecentury was far advanced before Lavoisier and Eumford finally
* Boerhaave followed Homberg in supposing the matter of heat to be present ia
all so-called vacuous spaces. t Scheele in 1777 supposed caloric to be a compound of oxygen and phlogiston, and light to be oxygen combined with a greater proportion of phlogiston.

proved that the temperature of a body is without sensibleinfluence on its weight.
Perhaps nothing in the history of natural philosophy is moreamazing than the vicissitudes of the theory of heat. The truehypothesis, after having met with general acceptance throughouta century, and having been approved by a succession of illus-trious men, was deliberately abandoned by their successorsin favour of a conception utterly false, and, in some of itsdevelopments, grotesque and absurd.
We must now return to s'Gravesande's book. The pheno-mena of combustion he explained by assuming that when a bodyis sufficiently heated the light-corpuscles interact with thematerial particles, some constituents being in consequence sepa-rated and carried away with the corpuscles as flame and smoke.This view harmonizes with the theory of calcination which hadbeen developed by Becher and his pupil Stahl at the end of the-seventeenth century, according to which the metals were supposed to be composed of their calces and an element phlogiston.The process of combustion, by which a metal is changed into its- calx, was interpreted as a decomposition, in which the phlogistonseparated from the metal and escaped into the atmosphere; while the conversion of the calx into the metal was regarded asa union with phlogiston.*
s'Gravesande attributed electric effects to vibrations inducedin effluvia, which he supposed to be permanently attached tosuch bodies as amber. " Glass," he asserted,
" contains in it, andhas about its surface, a certain atmosphere, which is excited byFriction and put into a vibratory motion ; for it attracts and* The correct idea of combustion had been advanced by Hooke. "The disso- lution of inflammable bodies," he asserts in the Micrographia, " is performed by a substance inherent in and mixed with the air, that is like, if not the very samewith, that which is fixed in saltpetre." But this statement met with little favourat the time, and the doctrine of the compound nature of metals survived in full vigour until the discovery of oxygen by Priestley and Scheele in 1771-5. In 1775Lavoisier reaffirmed Hooke's principle that a metallic calx is not the metal minusphlogiston, but the metal plus oxygen; and this idea, which carried with it the
recognition of the elementary nature of metals, was generally accepted by the end' of the eighteenth century.

The smallest parts of the glass are agitatedby the Attrition, and by reason of their elasticity, their motion is vibratory, which is communicated to the Atmosphere abovementioned : and therefore that Atmosphere exerts its action thefurther, the greater agitation the Parts of the Glass receive whena greater attrition is given to the glass."
The English translator of s'Gravesande's work was himselfdestined to play a considerable part in the history of electricalscience. Jean Theophile Desaguliers (b. 1683, d. 1744) was anEnglishman only by adoption. His father had been a Huguenotpastor, who, escaping from France after the revocation of the Edictof Nantes, brought away the boy from La Kochelle, concealed, it is said, in a tub. The young Desaguliers was afterwards ordained,and became chaplain to that Duke of Chandos who was soungratefully ridiculed by Pope. In this situation he formedfriendships with some of the natural philosophers of the capital,and amongst others with Stephen Gray, an experimenter ofwhom little is known* beyond the fact that he was a pensionerof the Charterhouse.
In 1729 Gray communicated, as he says,f
" to Dr. Desaguliersand some other Gentlemen " a discovery he had lately made," showing that the Electrick Vertue of a Glass Tube maybeconveyed to any other Bodies so as to give them the sameProperty of attracting and repelling light Bodies as the Tubedoes, when excited by rubbing : and that this attractive Vertuemight be carried to Bodies that were many Feet distant fromthe Tube."
This was a result of the greatest importance, for previousworkers had known of no other way of producing the attractiveemanations than by rubbing the body concerned.* It was found* Those M*ho are interested in the literary history of the eighteenth century will

that only a limited class of substances, among which the metalswere conspicuous, had the capacity of acting as channels for thetransport of the electric power ; to these Desaguliers, who. con-tinued the experiments after Gray's death in 1736, gavfc^ thename non-electrics or conductors. After Gray's discovery it was no longer possible to believethat the electric effluvia are inseparably connected with thebodies from which they are evoked by rubbing ; and it becamenecessary to admit that these emanations have an independentexistence, and can be transferred from one body to another.Accordingly we find them recognized, under the name of theelectric fluidft as one of the substances of which the world isconstituted. The imponderability of this fluid did not, for thereasons already mentioned, prevent its admission by the side oflight and caloric into the list of chemical elements.
The question was actively debated as to whether the electricfluid was an element sui generis, or, as some suspected, wasanother manifestation of that principle whose operation is seenin the phenomena of heat. Those who held the latter viewurged that the electric fluid and heat can both be induced byfriction, can both induce combustion, and can both be transferredfrom one body to another by mere contact ; and, moreover, thatthe best conductors of heat are also in general the best conductors of electricity. On the other hand it was contended thatthe electrification of a body does not cause any appreciable risein its temperature; and an experiment of Stephen Gray'sbrought to light a yet more striking difference. Gray,J in 1729,.made two oaken cubes, one solid and the other hollow, andshowed that when electrified in the same way they producedexactly similar effects ; whence he concluded that it was onlythe surfaces which had taken part in the phenomena. Thuswhile heat is disseminated throughout the substance of a body,the electric fluid resides at or near its surface. In the middleof* Phil. Trans, xli.

" The electricity which a non-electric of greatlength (for example, a hempen string 800 or 900 feet long)receives, runs from one end to the other in a sphere of electrical Effluvia" says Desaguliers in 1740 ^and a report of the FrenchAcademy in 1733 says :f " Around an electrified body there is formed a vortex of exceedingly fine matter in a state of agitation,,
which urges towards the body such light substances as lie within its sphere of activity. The existence of this vortex is more than a mere conjecture ; for when an electrified body i& brought close to the face it causes a sensation like that of encountering a cobweb."J The report from which this is quoted was prepared inconnexion with the discoveries of Charles-Francois du Fay(b. 1698, d. 1739), superintendent of gardens to the King of France. Du Fay accounted for the behaviour of gold leaf whenbrought near to an electrified glass tube by supposing that atfirst the vortex of the tube envelopes the gold-leaf, and so attractsit towards the tube. But when contact occurs, the gold-leafacquires the electric virtue, and so becomes surrounded by avortex of its own. The two vortices, striving to extend in contrary senses, repel each other, and the vortex of the tube,being the stronger, drives away that of the gold-leaf.
" It is then certain/' says du Fay,H
" that bodies which have becomeelectric by contact are repelled by those which have renderedthem electric ; but are they repelled likewise by other electrified bodies of all kinds ? And do electrified bodies differ from eachother in no respect save their intensity of electrification ? Anexamination of this matter has led me to a discovery which I should never have foreseen, and of which I believe no onehitherto has had the least idea."

He found, in fact, that when gold-leaf which had beenelectrified by contact with excited glass was brought near to anexcited piece of copal,* an attraction was manifested betweenthem. " I had expected," he writes,
" quite the opposite effect,since, according to my reasoning, the copal and gold-leaf, whichwere both electrified, should have repelled each other."Proceeding with his experiments he found that the gold-leaf,when electrified and repelled by glass, was attracted by allelectrified resinous substances, and that when repelled by thelatter it was attracted by the glass.
" We see, then," he continues," that there are two electricities of a totally different naturenamely, that of transparent solids, such as glass, crystal, &c.,and that of bituminous or resinous bodies, such as amber, copal,sealing-wax, &c. Each of them repels bodies which havecontracted an electricity of the same nature as its own, andattracts those whose electricity is of the contrary nature. Wesee even that bodies which are not themselves electrics canacquire either of these electricities, and that then their effectsare similar to those of the bodies which have communicateditto them."
To the two kinds of electricity whose existence was thusdemonstrated, du Fay gave the names vitreous and resinous, bywhich they have ever since been known.
An interest in electrical experiments seems to have spreadfrom du Fay to other members of the Court circle of Louis XV; and from 1745 onwards the Memoirs of the Academy containaseries of papers on the subject by the Abbe Jean-Antoine Nollet{&. 1700, d. 1770), afterwards preceptor in natural philosophyto the Koyal Family. Nollet attributed electric phenomenatothe movement in opposite directions of two currents of a fluid," very subtle and inflammable," which he supposed to be presentin all bodies under all circumstances.f When an electric isexcited by friction, part of this fluid escapes from its pores,forming an effluent stream; and this loss is repaired by an* A hard transparent resin, used in the preparation of varnish. t Cf.

prior to the Introduction of the Potentials. 41dtfiucnt stream of the same fluid entering the body from outside. Light bodies in the vicinity, being caught in one or other of these streams, are attracted or repelled from the excited electric. Nollet's theory was in great vogue for some time ; but six orseven years after its first publication, its author came across awork purporting to be a French translation of a book printedoriginally in England, describing experiments said to have beenmade at Philadelphia, in America, by one Benjamin Franklin."He could not at first believe," as Franklin tells us in his AutobiograpJvy,
" that such a work came from America, and saidit must have been fabricated by his enemies at Paris to decryhis system. Afterwards, having been assured that there really
existed such a person as Franklin at Philadelphia, which he haddoubted, he wrote and published a volume of letters, chiefly
addressed to me, defending his theory, and denying the verityof my experiments, and of the positions deduced from them."
We must now trace the events which led up to the discoverywhich so perturbed Nollet. In 1745 Pieter van Musschenbroek (6. 1692, d. 1761),Professor at Leyden, attempted to find a method of preservingelectric charges from the decay which was observed when thecharged bodies were surrounded by air. With this purpose hetried the effect of surrounding a charged mass of water by anenvelope of some non-conductor, e.g., glass. In one of his experiments, a phial of water was suspended from a gunbarrel by a wire let down a few inches into the water throughthe cork; and the gun-barrel, suspended on silk lines, wasapplied so near an excited glass globe that some metallic fringes
inserted into the gun-barrel touched the globe in motion.Under these circumstances a friend named Cimaeus, whohappened to grasp the phial with one hand, and touch the gunbarrel with the other, received a violent shock ; and it becameevident that a method of accumulating or intensifying theelectric power had been discovered.*
* The discovery was made independently in the same year by Ewald Georg von Kleist, Dean of Kumrain.
42 Electric and Magnetic Science o
Shortly after the discovery of the Leyden phial, as it wasnamed by Nollet, had become known in England, a Londonapothecary named William Watson (6. 1715, d. 1787)* noticedthat when the experiment is performed in this fashion theobserver feels the shock " in no other parts of his body but hisarms and breast "
; whence he inferred that in the act ofdischarge there is a transference of something which takes theshortest or best- conducting path between the gun-barrel andthe phial. This idea of transference seemed to him to bearsome similarity to Nollet's doctrine of afflux and efflux; andthere can indeed be little doubt that the Abbe's hypothesis,though totally false in itself, furnished some of the ideas fromwhich Watson, with the guidance of experiment, constructeda correct theory. In a memoiirt)read to the Eoyal Societyin October, 1746, he propounded the doctrine that electricalactions are due to the presence of an " electrical aether/' whichin the charging or discharging of a Leyden jar is transferred, butis not created or destroyed. The excitation of an electric,according to this view, consists not in the evoking of anythingfrom within the electric itself without compensation, but in theaccumulation of a surplus of electrical aether by the electric atthe expense of some other body, whose stock is accordinglydepleted. All bodies were supposed to possess a certain naturalstore, which could be drawn upon for this purpose.
" I have shewn," wrote Watson,
" that electricity is theeffect of a very subtil and elastic fluid, occupying all bodiesincontact with the terraqueous globe ; and that every-where,inits natural state, it is of the same degree of density ; and thatglass and other bodies, which we denominate electrics persey
. have the power, by certain known operations, of taking this fluidfrom one body, and conveying it to another, in a quantitysufficient to be obvious to all our senses; and that, under* Watson afterwards rose to eminence in the medical profession, and wasknighted. t Phil.

prior to the Introduction ofthe Potentials. 43certain circumstances, it was possible to render the electricity in some bodies more rare than it naturally is, and, by communicating this to other bodies, to give them an additional quantity,
and make their electricity more dense." In the same year in which Watson's theory was proposed, a
certain Dr. Spence, who had lately arrived in America fromScotland, was showing in Boston some electrical experiments.
Among his audience was a man who already at forty years of age was recognized as one of the leading citizens of the Englishcolonies in America, Benjamin Franklin of Philadelphia (b. 1706,
d. 1790). Spence's experiments
" were," writes Franklin,*
" imperfectly performed, as he was not very expert ; but, being on a subject quite new to me, they equally surprised andpleased me." Soon after this, the "Library Company" of Philadelphia (an institution founded by Franklin himself)
received from Mr. Peter Collinson of London a present of a glass
tube, with some account of its use. In a letter written to Collinson on July llth, 1747,f Franklin described experiments
made with this tube, and certain deductions which he haddrawn from them.
If one person A, standing on wax so that electricity cannotpass from him to the ground, rubs the tube, and if another
person B, likewise standing on wax, passes his knuckle along near the glass so as to receive its electricity, then both A and Bwill be capable of giving a spark to a third person C standing on the floor; that is, they will be electrified. If, however, Aand B touch each other, either during or after the rubbing, they
will not be electrified. This observation suggested to Franklin the same hypothesis
that (unknown to him) had been propounded a few monthspreviously by Watson : namely, that electricity is an element
present in a certain proportion in all matter in its normalcondition ; so that, before the rubbing, each of the persons A,B, and C has an equal share. The effect of the rubbing is to

transfer some of A's electricity to the glass, whence it istransferred to B. Thus A has a deficiency and B a superfluityof electricity ; and if either of them approaches C, who hasthenormal amount, the distribution will be equalized by a spark.If, however, A and B are in contact, electricity flows betweenthem so as to re-establish the original equality, and neitheristhen electrified with reference to C. Thus electricity is not created by rubbing the glass, butonly transferred to the glass from the rubber, so that therubber loses exactly as much as the glass gains ; the, totalquantity of electricity in any insulated system is invariable. Thisassertion is usually known as the principle of conservationofelectric charge.
The condition of A and B in the experiment can evidentlybe expressed by plus and minus signs : A having a deficiency- e and B a superfluity + e of electricity. Franklin, at thecommencement of his own experiments, was not acquaintedwith du Fay's discoveries ; but it is evident that the electricfluid of Franklin is identical with the vitreous electricityofdu Fay, and that du Fay's resinous electricity is, in Franklin'stheory, merely the deficiency of a stock of vitreous electricitysupposed to be possessed naturally by all ponderable bodies.In Franklin's theory we are spared the necessity for admittingthat two quasi-material bodies can by their union annihilate eachother, as vitreous and resinous electricity were supposed to do.Some curiosity will naturally be felt as to the considerationswhich induced Franklin to attribute the positive charactertovitreous rather than to resinous electricity. They seem to havebeen founded on a comparison of the brush discharges fromconductors charged with the two electricities; whentheelectricity was resinous, the discharge was observed to spreadover the surface of the opposite conductor " as if it flowed fromit." Again, if a Leyden jar whose inner coating is electrifiedvitreously is discharged silently by a conductor, of whose pointedends one is near the knob and the other near the outer coating,the point which is near the knob is seen in the dark to be illumi-
prior to the Introduction of the Potentials. 45nated with a star or globule, while the point which is near the
outer coating is illuminated with a pencil of rays; which
suggested to Franklin that the electric fluid, going from the
inside to the outside of the jar, enters at the former point and
issues from the latter. And yet again, in some cases the flame
of a wax taper is blown away from a brass ball which is discharging vitreous electricity, and towards one which is discharging resinous electricity. But Franklin remarks that
the interpretation of these observations is somewhat conjectural,
and that whether vitreous or resinous electricity is the actual
electric fluid is not certainly known.
Regarding the physical nature of electricity, Franklin held
much the same ideas as his contemporaries ; he pictured it as an elastic* fluid, consisting of " particles extremely subtile, since
it can permeate common matter, even the densest metals, with
such ease and freedom as not to receive any perceptible
resistance." He departed, however, to some extent from the
conceptions of his predecessors, who were accustomed to ascribe
all electrical repulsions to the diffusion of effluvia from the
excited electric to the body acted on ; so that the tickling
sensation which is experienced when a charged body is brought
near to the human face was attributed to a direct action of the
effluvia on the skin. This doctrine, which, as we shall see, practically ended with Franklin, bears a suggestive resemblance
to that which nearly a century later was introduced by
Faraday ; both explained electrical phenomena without intro- ducing action at a distance, by supposing that something which
forms an essential part of the electrified system is present at the spot where any electric action takes place ; but in the older theory this something was identified with the electric fluid
itself, while in the modern view it is identified with a state of
stress in the aether. In the interval between the fall of one
school and the rise of the other, the theory of action at a
distance was dominant.
The germs of the last-mentioned theory may be found in
*i.c., repulsive of its own particles.
46 Electric and Magnetic Science
Franklin's own writings. It originated in connexion withtheexplanation of the Leyden jar, a matter which is discussedin his third letter to Collinson, of date September 1st, 1747.In charging the jar, he says, a quantity of electricity is takenaway from one side of the glass, by means of the coatingin contact with it, and an equal quantity is communicated to the other side, by means of the other coating. Theglass itself he supposes to be impermeable to the electricfluid, so that the deficiency on the one side can permanentlycoexist with the redundancy on the other, so long as thetwosides are not connected with each other ; but when a con-nexion is set up, the distribution of fluid is equalized throughthe body of the experimenter, who receives a shock.
Compelled by this theory of the jar to regard glassasimpenetrable to electric effluvia, Franklin was nevertheless wellaware* that the interposition of a glass plate betweenanelectrified body and the objects of its attraction does not shieldthe latter from the attractive influence. He was thus driventosupposef that the surface of the glass which is nearest theexcited body is directly affected, and is able to exertaninfluence through the glass on the opposite surface ; the lattersurface, which thus receives a kind of secondary or derivedexcitement, is responsible for the electric effects beyond it. This idea harmonized admirably with the phenomenaofthe jar ; for it was now possible to hold that the excessofelectricity on the inner face exercises a repellent action throughthe substance of the glass, and so causes a deficiency ontheouter faces by driving away the electricity from it.J Franklin had thus arrived at what was really a theoryofaction at a distance between the particles of the electric fluid;and this he was able to support by other experiments.
" Thus,"he writes,
" the stream of a fountain, naturally dense andcontinual, when electrified, will separate and spread in the formofa brush, every drop endeavouring to recede from every other* New Experiments, 1750, 28. t Hid., 1750, 34. J Ibid., 1750, 32. Letter v.
prior to the Introduction of the Potentials. 47drop.' In order to account for the attraction between
oppositely charged bodies, in one of which there is an excess of electricity as compared with ordinary matter, and in the other an excess of ordinary matter as compared with electricity, he
assumed that " though the particles of electrical matter do repel
each other, they are strongly attracted by all other matter "
; so that " common matter is as a kind of spunge to the electrical
fluid." These repellent and attractive powers he assigned only to the actual (vitreous) electric fluid; and when later on the
mutual repidsion of resinously electrified bodies became knownto him,* it caused him considerable perplexity.f As we shall see, the difficulty was eventually removed by.Aepinus.
In spite of his belief in the power of electricity to act at a
distance, Franklin did not abandon the doctrine of effluvia. "The form of the electrical atmosphere," he says,} "is that of the
body it surrounds. This shape may be rendered visible in a still air, by raising a smoke from dry rosin dropt into a hot tea- spoon under the electrified body, which will be attracted, and
spread itself equally on all sides, covering and concealing the
body, And this form it takes, because it is attracted by all parts of the surface of the body, though it cannot enter the
substance already replete. Without this attraction, it would
not remain round the body, but dissipate in the air." Heobserved, however, that electrical effluvia do not seem to
affect, or be affected by, the air ; since it is possible to breathe
freely in the neighbourhood of electrified bodies ; and moreover
a current of dry air does not destroy electric attractions and
repulsions.
Kegarding the suspected identity of electricity with the
matter of heat, as to which Nollet had taken the affirmative
position, Franklin expressed no opinion.
" Common fire," he

Franklin's work did not at first receive from Europeanphilosophers the attention which it deserved ; although Watsongenerously endeavoured to make the colonial writer's meritsknown,f and inserted some of Franklin's letters in one of his ownpapers communicated to the Eoyal Society. But an accountofFranklin's discoveries, which had been printed in England,happened to fall into the hands of the naturalist Buffon, whowasso much impressed that he secured the issue of a French transla-tion of the work ; and it was this publication which, as wehaveseen, gave such offence to Nollet. The success of a plan proposedby Franklin for drawing lightning from the clouds soon engagedpublic attention everywhere; and in a short time the triumphof the one-fluid theory of electricity, as the hypothesisofWatson and Franklin is generally called, was complete. Collet,who was obdurate, "lived to see himself the last of his sect,except Monsieur B of Paris, his eleve and immediatedisciple."J The theory of effluvia was finally overthrown, and replacedby that of action at a distance, by the labours of oneofFranklin's continental followers, Francis Ulrich TheodoreAepinus (&. 1724, d. 1802). The doctrine that glass isimpermeable to electricity, which had formed the basis ofFranklin's theory of the Leyden phial, was generalized byAepinus||and his co-worker Johann Karl Wilcke (5. 1732, d. 1796)into the law that all non-conductors are impermeable to the* Letter v.

however, air took the place of glass as the medium between
two oppositely charged surfaces. The success of this experiment led Aepinus to deny altogether the existence of electric
effluvia surrounding charged bodies :* a position which he
regarded as strengthened by Franklin's observation, that the
electric field in the neighbourhood of an excited body is not
destroyed when the adjacent air is blown away. The electric
fluid must therefore be supposed not to extend beyond the
excited bodies themselves. The experiment of Gray, to whichwe have already referred, showed that it does not penetrate
far into their substance; and thus it became necessary to suppose that the electric fluid, in its state of rest, is confined to thin layers on the surfaces of the excited bodies. This being granted, the attractions and repulsions observed
between the bodies compel us to believe that electricity acts at a distance across the intervening air. Since two vitreously charged bodies repel each other, the
force between two particles of the electric fluid must (on
Franklin's one-fluid theory, which Aepinus adopted) be
repulsive : and since there is 'an attraction between oppositely
charged bodies, the force between electricity and ordinary
matter must be attractive. These assumptions had been made,
as we have seen, by Franklin; but in order to account for the repulsion between two resinously charged bodies, Aepinusintroduced a new supposition namely, that the particles
of ordinary matter repel each other. This, at first, startled
his contemporaries; but, as he pointed out, the "unelectrified"
matter with which we are acquainted is really matter saturated
with its natural quantity of the electric fluid, and the forces due to the matter and fluid balance each other ; or perhaps,
as he suggested, a slight want of equality between these
forces might give, as a residual, the force of gravitation.
Assuming that the attractive and repellent forces increase as

50 Electric and Magnetic Science <v the distance between the acting charges decreases, Aepinusapplied his theory to explain a phenomenon which had beenmore or less indefinitely observed by many previous writers, andspecially studied a short time previously by John Canton*(&. 1718, d. 1772) and by Wilckef namely, that if a conductoris brought into the neighbourhood of an excited body withoutactually touching it, the remoter portion of the conductoracquires an electric charge of the same kind as that of theexcited body, while the nearer portion acquires a charge of theopposite kind. This effect, which is known as the inductionofelectric charges, had been explained by Canton himself andbyFranklin} in terms of the theory of electric effluvia. Aepinusshowed that it followed naturally from the theory of action atadistance, by taking into account the mobility of the electric fluidin conductors ; and by discussing different cases, so far as waspossible with the means at his command, he laid the foundationsof the mathematical theory of electrostatics. Aepinus did not succeed in determining the law accordingtowhich the force between two electric charges varies with thedistance between them ; and the honour of having first accomplished this belongs to Joseph Priestley (b. 1733, d. 1804), thediscoverer of oxygen. Priestley, who was a friend of Franklin's,had been informed by the latter that he had found cork balls tobe wholly unaffected by the electricity of a metal cup withinwhich they were held ; and Franklin desired Priestley to repeatand ascertain the fact. Accordingly, on December 21st, 1766,Priestley instituted experiments, which showed that, whenahollow metallic vessel is electrified, there is no charge on the innersurface (except near the opening), and no electric force in theairinside. From this he at once drew the correct conclusion, whichwas published in 1767. " May we not infer," he says, "from*Phil.

prior to the Introduction of the Potentials. 51this experiment that the attraction of electricity is subject to the same laws with that of gravitation, and is therefore according
to the squares of the distances ; since it is easily demonstrated
that were the earth in the form of a shell, a body in the inside
of it would not be attracted to one side more than another ? " This brilliant inference seems to have been insufficiently
studied by the scientific men of the day ; and, indeed, its author
appears to have hesitated to claim for it the authority of a complete and rigorous proof. Accordingly we find that the question
of the law of force was not regarded as finally settled for eighteen
years afterwards.* By Franklin's law of the conservation of electric charge, andPriestley's law of attraction between charged bodies, electricity was raised to the position of an exact science. It is impossible
to mention the names of these two friends in such a connexion
without reflecting on the curious parallelism of their lives. In
both men there was the same combination of intellectual bold- ness and power with moral earnestness and public spirit. Both.of them carried on a long and tenacious struggle with the reac- tionary influences which dominated the English Government in
.the reign of George III ; and both at last, when overpowered in the conflict, reluctantly exchanged their native flag for that of the United States of America. The names of both have been
held in honour by later generations, not more for their
scientific discoveries than for their services to the cause of
religious, intellectual, and political freedom.
The most celebrated electrician of Priestley's contemporaries
in London was the Hon. Henry Cavendish (b. 1731, d. 1810),
whose interest in the subject was indeed hereditary, for his
father, Lord Charles Cavendish, had assisted in Watson's experiments of 1747.f In 1771 Cavendish} presented to the Koyal
Society an

adopted is that of the one-fluid theory, in much the same formas that of Aepinus. It was, as he tells us, discovered independently, although he became acquainted with Aepinus' workbefore the publication of his own paper. In this memoir Cavendish makes no assumption regardingthe law of force between electric charges, except that it is" inversely as some less power of the distance than the cube";but he evidently inclines to believe in the law of the inversesquare. Indeed, he shows it to be " likely, that if the electricattraction or repulsion is inversely as the square of the distance,almost all the redundant fluid in the body will be lodged closeto the surface, and there pressed close together, and the restofthe body will be saturated"; which approximates closely to thediscovery made four years previously by Priestley. Cavendishdid, as a matter of fact, rediscover the inverse square law shortlyafterwards; but, indifferent to fame, he neglected to communicateto others this and much other work of importance. The valueofhis researches was not realized until the middle of the nineteenthcentury, when William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) found in Cavendish's manuscripts the correct value for the ratio of the electriccharges carried by a circular disk and a sphere of the same radiuswhich had been placed in metallic connexion. Thomson urgedthat the papers should be published ; which came to pass*in1879, a hundred years from the date of the great discoverieswhich they enshrined. It was then seen that Cavendish hadanticipated his successors in several of the ideas which willpresently be discussed amongst others, those of electrostaticcapacity and specific inductive capacity.
In the published memoir of 1771 Cavendish worked out theconsequences of his fundamental hypothesis more completelythan Aepinus ; and, in fact, virtually introduced the notionofelectric potential, though, in the absence of any definite assumption as to the law of force, it was impossible to develop this ideato any great extent.
* The Electrical Researches of the Hon. Henry Cavendish, edited by J. ClerkMaxwell, 1879.
prior to the Introduction of the Potentials. 53One of the investigations with which Cavendish occupied
himself was a comparison between the conducting powers of different materials for electrostatic discharges. The question
had been first raised by Beccaria, who had shown* in 1753 that
when the circuit through which a discharge is passed contains
tubes of water, the shock is more powerful when the cross-section of the tubes is increased. Cavendish went into the mattermuch more thoroughly, and was able, in a memoir presented to the Eoyal Society in 1775,f to say : " It appears from someexperiments, of which I propose shortly to lay an account before
this Society, that iron wire conducts about 400 million timesbetter than rain or distilled water that is, the electricity meetswith no more resistance in passing through a piece of iron wire400,000,000 inches long than through a column of water of the same diameter only one inch long. Sea-water, or a solution of one part of salt in 30 of water, conducts 100 times, or a saturated
solution of sea-salt about 720 times, better than rain-water."
The promised account of the experiments was published in the volume edited in 1879. It appears from it that the methodof testing by which Cavendish obtained these, results wassimply that of physiological sensation; but the figures givenin the comparison of iron and sea-water are remarkably exact. While the theory of electricity was being established on a surefoundation by the great investigators of the eighteenth century, a no less remarkable development was taking place in thekindred science of magnetism, to which our attention must nowbe directed. The law of attraction between magnets was investigated at an earlier date than the corresponding law for electrically
charged bodies. Newton, in the Principia says : " The power of gravity is of a different nature from the power of magnetism.For the magnetic attraction is not as the matter attracted. Some bodies are attracted more by the magnet, others less ; mostbodies not at all. The power of magnetism, in one and the same* G. B.

body, may be increased and diminished ; and is sometimesfarstronger, for the quantity of matter, than the power of gravity;and in receding from the magnet, decreases not in the duplicate,but almost in the triplicate proportion of the distance, as nearlyas I could judge from some rude observations."
The edition of ihePrincipia which was published in 1742byThomas Le Seur and Francis Jacquier contains a note on thiscorollary, in which the correct result is obtained that thedirective couple exercised on one magnet by anotherisproportional to the inverse cube of the distance. The first discoverer of the law of force between magnetic1
\ poles was John Michell (b. 1724, d. 1793), at that time a youngFellow of Queen's College, Cambridge,* who in 1750 publishedA Treatise of Artificial Magnets ; in ivhich is shown an easyand expeditious method of making them superior to the lestnatural ones. In this he states the principles of magnetictheory as followsf : " Wherever any Magnetism, is found, whether in the Magnetitself, or any piece of Iron, etc., excited by the Magnet, there arealways found two Poles, which are generally called NorthandSouth ; and the North Pole of one Magnet always attracts theSouth Pole, and repels the North Pole of another: and wee versa"This is of course adopted from Gilbert. "Each Pole attracts or repels exactly equally, at equaldistances, in every direction." This, it may be observed, over-throws the theory of vortices, with which it is irreconcilable." The Magnetical Attraction and Eepulsion are exactly equaltoeach other." This, obvious though it may seem to us, was reallya most important advance, for, as he remarks,
" Most people, who* Michell had taken his degree only two years previously. Later in life he wason terms of friendship with Priestley, Cavendish, and William Herschel ; it washe who taught Herschel the art of grinding mirrors for telescopes. The planofdetermining the density of the earth, which was carried out by Cavendish in 1798,and is generally known as the " Cavendish Experiment," was due to Michell.Michell was the first inventor of the torsion-balance ; he also made many valuablecontributions to Astronomy.

" The Attraction and Eepulsion of Magnets decreases, as theSquares of the distances from the respective poles increase."This great discovery, which is the basis of the mathematicaltheory of Magnetism, was deduced partly from his own observations, and partly from those of previous investigators (e.g. Dr. Brook Taylor and P. Muschenbroek), who, as he observes,had made accurate experiments, but had failed to take intoaccount all the considerations necessary for a sound theoreticaldiscussion of them.
After Michell the law of the inverse square was maintainedby Tobias Mayer* of Gottingen (&. 1723, d. 1762), better knownas the author of Lunar Tables which were long in use ; and bythe celebrated mathematician, Johann Heinrich Lambertf (b. 1728, d. 1777).
The promulgation of the one-fluid theory of electricity, inthe middle of the eighteenth century, naturally led to attemptsto construct a similar theory of magnetism ; this was effected in1759 by AepinusJ, who supposed the "poles "to be places atwhich a magnetic fluid was present in amount exceeding orfalling short of the normal quantity. The permanence ofmagnets was accounted for by supposing the fluid to be entangledin their pores, so as to be with difficulty displaced. The particlesof the fluid were assumed to repel each other, and to attract theparticles of iron and steel ; but, as Aepinus saw, in order to satis-factorily explain magnetic phenomena it was necessary to assumealso a mutual repulsion among the material particles of themagnet.
Subsequently two imponderable magnetic fluids, to which* Noticed in Gottinger Gelehrter Anzeiger, 1760 : cf. Aepinus, Nov. Comm.Acad. Petrop., 1768, and Mayer's Opera Inedita, herausg. von G. C.

the names boreal and austral were assigned, were postulated bythe Hollander Anton Brugmans (5. 1732, d. 1789) andbyWilcke. These fluids were supposed to have properties ofmutual attraction and repulsion similar to those possessed byvitreous and resinous electricity.
The writer who next claims our attention for his servicesboth to magnetism and to electricity is the French physicist,Charles Augustin Coulomb* (ft. 1736, d. 1806). By aid of thetorsion-balance, which was independently invented by Michelland himself, he verified in 1785 Priestley's fundamental lawthat the repulsive force between two small globes charged withthe same kind of electricity is in the inverse ratio of the squareof the distance of their centres. In the second memoirheextended this law to the attraction of opposite electricities. Coulomb did not accept the one-fluid theory of Franklin,Aepinus, and Cavendish, but preferred a rival hypothesis whichhad been proposed in 1759 by Kobert Symmer.f
" My notion,"said Symmer,
"
is that the operations of electricity do not dependupon one single positive power, according to the opinion generallyreceived; but upon two distinct, positive, and active powers,which, by contrasting, and, as it were, counteracting each other,produce the various phenomena of electricity ; and that, whenabody is said to be positively electrified, it is not simply that it ispossessed of a larger share of electric matter than in a naturalstate ; nor, when it is said to be negatively electrified, of a less; but that, in the former case, it is possessed of a larger portionof one of those active powers, and in the latter, of a largerportion of the other ; while a body in its natural state remainsunelectrified, from an equal ballance of those two powers withinit." Coulomb developed this idea : " Whatever be the causeofelectricity," he says,J
" we can explain all the phenomenaby* Coulomb's First, Second, and Third Memoirs appear in Memoires de 1'Acad.,1785 ; the Fourth in 1786, the Fifth in 1787, the Sixth in 1788, and the Seventhin 1789. t Phil. Trim*, li (1759), p. 371. j Sixth Memoir, p. 561.
prior to the Introduction of the Potentials. 57supposing that there are two electric fluids, the parts of thesame fluid repelling each other according to the inverse squareof the distance, and attracting the parts of the other fluid according to the same inverse square law." " The supposition^of two fluids," he adds,
"
is moreover in accord with all those7discoveries of modern chemists and physicists, which have madeknown to us various pairs of gases whose elasticity is destroyedby their admixture in certain proportions an effect which couldnot take place without something equivalent to a repulsionbetween the parts of the same gas, which is the cause of its elasticity, and an attraction between the parts of different gases, which accounts for the loss of elasticity on combination."JAccording, then, to the two-fluid theory, the " natural fluid
" contained in all matter can be decomposed, under the influence
of an electric field, into equal quantities of vitreous andresinous electricity, which, if the matter be conducting, can thenfly to the surface of the body. The abeyance of the characteristic properties of the opposite electricities when in combination wasf sometimes further compared to the neutrality manifested by. the compound of an acid and an alkali. The publication of Coulomb's views led to some controversybetween the partisans of the one-fluid and two-fluid theories ; thelatter was soon generally adopted in France, but was stoutly
opposed in Holland by Van Marum and in Italy by Volta. The chief difference between the rival hypotheses is that, in the^two-fluid theory, both the electric fluids are movable within thesubstance of a solid conductor ; while in the one-fluid theory theactual electric fluid is mobile, but the particles of the conductorare fixed. The dispute could therefore be settled only by a deter- mination of the actual motion of electricity in discharges ; andthis was beyond the reach of experiment.
In his Fourth Memoir Coulomb showed that electricity in equilibrium is confined to the surface of conductors, and doesnot penetrate to their interior substance ; and in the SixthMemoir* he virtually establishes the result that the electric

force near a conductor is proportional to the surface-density ofelectrification. Since the overthrow of the doctrine of electric effluvia byAepinus, the aim of electricians had been to establish theirscience upon the foundation of a law of action at a distance,resembling that which had led to such triumphs in CelestialMechanics. When the law first stated by Priestley wasatlength decisively established by Coulomb, its simplicity andbeauty gave rise to a general feeling of complete trust in it asthe best attainable conception of electrostatic phenomena.The result was that attention was almost exclusively focusedon action-at-a-distance theories, until the time, long afterwards,,when Faraday led natural philosophers back to the right'path.
Coulomb rendered great services to magnetic theory. It washe who in 1777, by simple mechanical reasoning, completedthe overthrow of the hypothesis of vortices.* He also, in thesecond of the Memoirs already quoted,f confirmed Michell'slaw, according to which the particles of the magnetic fluidsattract or repel each other with forces proportional to theinverse square of the distance. Coulomb, however, went beyondthis, and endeavoured to account for the fact that the twomagnetic fluids, unlike the two electric fluids, cannot beobtained separately; for when a magnet is broken intotwo pieces, one containing its north and the other its southpole, it is found that each piece is an independent magnetpossessing two poles of its own, so that it is impossibleto obtain a north or south pole in a state of isolation.Coulomb explained this by supposing^ that the magnetic fluids are permanently imprisoned within the moleculesof magnetic bodies, so as to be incapable of crossing fromone molecule to the next ; each molecule therefore underallcircumstances contains as much of the boreal as of the* Mem. presences par divers Savans, ix (1780), p. 165.

Sucha hypothesis evidently accounts for the impossibility ofseparating the two fluids to opposite ends of a body of finitesize. The same idea, here introduced for the first time, hassince been applied with success in other departments ofelectrical philosophy.
In spite of the advances which have been recounted,the mathematical development of electric and magnetic theorywas scarcely begun at the close of the eighteenth century ; andmany erroneous notions were still widely entertained. In aEeport* which was presented to the French Academy in 1800,it was assumed that the mutual repulsion of the particles ofelectricity on the surface of a body is balanced by theresistance of the surrounding air; and for long afterwardsthe electric force outside a charged conductor was confusedwith a supposed additional pressure in the atmosphere.
Electrostatical theory was, however, suddenly advanced toquite a mature state of development by Simeon Denis Poisson(b. 1781, d. 1840), in a memoir which was read to the FrenchAcademy in 1812.f As the opening sentences show, he acceptedthe conceptions of the two-fluid theory.
" The theory of electricity which is most generally accepted,"he says,
"
is that which attributes the phenomena to twodifferent fluids, which are contained in all material bodies.It is supposed that molecules of the same fluid repel eachother and attract the molecules of the other fluid ; theseforces of attraction and repulsion obey the law of the inversesquare of the distance ; and at the same distance the attractivepower is equal to the repellent power; whence it followsthat, when all the parts of a body contain equal quantitiesof the two fluids, the latter do not exert any influence onthe fluids contained in neighbouring bodies, and consequentlyno electrical effects are discernible. This equal and uniform* On Yolla's discoveries.

distribution of the two fluids is called the natural state ; when thisstate is disturbed in any body, the body is said to be electrified,and the various phenomena of electricity begin to take place.
"Material bodies do not all behave in the same way withrespect to the electric fluid : some, such as the metals, donot appear to exert any influence on it, but permit it tomove about freely in their substance ; for this reason theyare called conductors. Others, on the contrary very dry air,for example oppose the passage of the electric fluid in theirinterior, so that they can prevent the fluid accumulated inconductors from being dissipated throughout space."
When an excess of one of the electric fluids is communicated to a metallic body, this charge distributes itself over thesurface of the body, forming a layer whose thickness at anypoint depends on the shape of the surface. The resultant forcedue to the repulsion of all the particles of this surface-layermust vanish at any point in the interior of the conductor, sinceotherwise the natural state existing there would be disturbed; and Poisson showed that by aid of this principle it is possiblein certain cases to determine the distribution of electricity inthe surface-layer. For example, a well-known proposition ofthe theory of Attractions asserts that a hollow shell whosebounding surfaces are two similar and similarly situatedellipsoids exercises 110 attractive force at any point within theinterior hollow; and it may thence be inferred that, if anelectrified metallic conductor has the form of an ellipsoid, thecharge will be distributed on it proportionally to the normaldistance from the surface to an adjacent similar and similarlysituated ellipsoid.
Poisson went on to show that this result was by no meansallthat might with advantage be borrowed from the theoryofI Attractions. Lagrange, in a memoir on the motion of gravitatingbodies, had shown* that the components of the attractive force* Mem. de Berlin, 1777. The theorem was afterwards published, and ascribedto Laplace, in a memoir by Legendre on the Attractions of Spheroids, which willbe found in the Mem. par divers Snvanx, published in 178o.
prior to the Introduction of the Potentials. 61at any point can be simply expressed as the derivates of thefunction which is obtained by adding together the masses of all the particles of an attracting system, each divided by its distance from the point; and Laplace had shown* that thisfunction V satisfies the equation
in space free from attracting matter. Poisson himself showedlater, in 1813,f that when the point (z, y, z) is within thesubstance of the attracting body, this equation of Laplace mustbe replaced by W VV VV ^
+ w~~vr: p> where p denotes the density of the attracting matter at thepoint. In the present memoir Poisson called attention to theutility of this function F in electrical investigations, remarkingthat its value over the surface of any conductor must beconstant. The known formulae for the attractions of spheroids showthat when a charged conductor is spheroidal, the repellent forceacting on a small charged body immediately outside it will bedirected at right angles to the surface of the spheroid, and willbe proportional to the thickness of the surface-layer of electricityat this place. Poisson suspected that this theorem might betrue for conductors not having the spheroidal form a resultwhich, as we have seen, had been already virtually given byCoulomb ; and Laplace suggested to Poisson the followingproof, applicable to the general case. The force at a pointimmediately outside the conductor can be divided into apart s due to the part of the charged surface immediatelyadjacent to the point, and a part S due to the rest ofthe surface. At a point close to this, but just inside the conductor, the force j^jpll still act; but the forces will evidently* Mem. de 1'Acad., 1782 (published in 1785), p. 113. t Bull, de la Soc.

be reversed in direction. Since the resultant force at the latterpoint vanishes, we must have S=s ; so the resultant force at theexterior point is 2s. But s is proportional to the charge perunit area of the surface, as is seen by considering the case ofan infinite plate ; which establishes the theorem.
When several conductors are in presence of each other, thedistribution of electricity on their surfaces may be determinedby the principle, which Poisson took as the basis of his work,that at any point in the interior of any one of the conductors,the resultant force due to all the surface-layers must be zero.He discussed, in particular, one of the classical problemsofelectrostatics namely, that of determining the surface-densityon two charged conducting spheres placed at any distance fromeach other. The solution depends on Double Gamma Functionsin the general case ; when the two spheres are in contact, itdepends on ordinary Gamma Functions. Poisson gave a solutionin terms of definite integrals, which is equivalent to that interms of Gamma Functions ; and after reducing his results tonumbers, compared them with Coulomb's experiments.
f The rapidity with which in a single memoir Poisson passedfrom the barest elements of the subject to such reconditeproblems as those just mentioned may well excite admiration.His success is, no doubt, partly explained by the high state ofdevelopment to which analysis had been advanced by the greatmathematicians of the eighteenth century ; but even afterallowance has been made for what is due to his predecessors,Poisson's investigation must be accounted a splendid memorialu of his genius.
Some years later Poisson turned his attention to magnetism; and, in a masterly paper* presented to the French Academyin1824, gave a remarkably complete theory of the subject.
His starting-point is Coulomb's doctrine of two imponderablemagnetic fluids, arising from the decomposition of a neutralfluid, and confined in their movements to the individual elements* Mem. <le 1'Acad., v, p. 247.

Suppose that an amount m of the positive magnetic fluid is located at a point (x y, z) ; the components of the magnetic

where the quantity A, which does not involve (f, j, ), may becalled the magnetic moment of the element : it may be measuredby the couple required to maintain the element in equilibrium
at a definite angular distance from the magnetic meridian.
If the displacement of the two fluids from each other in the
element is not parallel to the axis of xt it is easily seen that the
expression corresponding to the last is

where the vector (A, B, C) or I represents the magnetic momentper unit-volume, or, as it is generally called, the magnetization.The function Fwas afterwards named by Green the magneticpotential.
Poisson, by integrating by parts the preceding expression forthe magnetic potential, obtained it in the form

These fictitious magnetizations are generallyknown as Poisson's equivalent surface- and volume-distributionsof magnetism.
Poisson, moreover, perceived that at a point in a very smallcavity excavated within the magnetic body, the magneticpotential has a limiting value which is independent of the shapeof the cavity as the dimensions of the cavity tend to zero ; butthat this is not true of the magnetic intensity, which in suchasmall cavity depends on the shape of the cavity.

prior to the Introduction of the Potentials. 65This memoir also contains a discussion of the magnetismtemporarily induced in soft iron and other magnetizable metalsby the approach of a permanent magnet. Poisson accounted for the properties of temporary magnets by assuming that theycontain embedded in their substance a great number of smallspheres, which are perfect conductors for the magnetic fluids ; so that the resultant magnetic intensity in the interior of one of these small spheres must be zero. He showed that such a sphere,
when placed in a field of magnetic intensity F,* must acquire amagnetic moment of amount -.- F x the volume of the sphere,
in order to counteract within the sphere the force F. Thus if kp denote the total volume of these spheres contained within aunit volume of the temporary magnet, the magnetization will beI, where 4-TrI = kp F, and F denotes the magnetic intensity within a spherical cavity
excavated in the body. This is Poisson s laiv ofinduced magnetism.It is known that some substances acquire a greater degreeof temporary magnetization than others when placed in the same circumstances : Poisson accounted for this by supposing thatthe quantity kp varies from one substance to another. But the
experimental data show that for soft iron kp must have a valuevery near unity, which would obviously be impossible if kp
is to mean the ratio of the volume of spheres contained within a
region to the total volume of the region.f The physical inter- pretation assigned by Poisson to his formulae must therefore berejected, although the formulae themselves retain their value. Poisson's electrical and magiietical investigations weregeneralized and extended in 1828 by George Green* (b. 1793,
d. 1841). Green's treatment is based on the properties of thefunction already used by Lagrange, Laplace, and Poisson, which* In the present work, vectors will generally be distinguished by heavy type. t This objection was advanced by Maxwell in 430 of his Treatise. An attempt
to overcome it was made by Betti : cf. p. 377 of his Lessons on the Potential. J A.n essay on the application ofmathematical analysis to the theories ofelectricity and magnetism, Nottingham, 1828 : reprinted in The Mathematical Papers ofthe late George Green, p. 1. F

represents the sum of all the electric or magnetic charges in thefield, divided by their respective distances from some given point: to this function Green gave the name potential, by which it hasalways since been known.*
Near the beginning of the memoir is established thecelebrated formula connecting surface and volume integrals,which is now generally called G-reeris Theorem, and of whichPoisson's result on the equivalent surface- and volume-distributions of magnetization is a particular application. By usingthis theorem to investigate the properties of the potential,Green arrived at many results of remarkable beauty andinterest. We need only mention, as an example of the powerof his method, the following : Suppose that there is a hollowconducting shell, bounded by two closed surfaces, and thatanumber of electrified bodies are placed, some within and somewithout it ; and let the inner surface and interior bodies becalled the interior system, and the outer surface and exteriorbotlies be called the exterior system. Then all the electricalphenomena of the interior system, relative to attractions,repulsions, and densities, will be the same as if there werenoexterior system, and the inner surface were a perfect conductor,put in communication with the earth ; and all those of theexterior system will be the same as if the interior system did notexist, and the outer surface were a perfect conductor, containinga quantity of electricity equal to the whole of that originallycontained in the shell itself and in all the interior bodies.
It will be evident that electrostatics had by this timeattained a state of development in which further progress couldbe hoped for only in the mathematical superstructure, unlessexperiment should unexpectedly bring to light phenomenaofan entirely new character. This will therefore be a convenientplace to pause and consider the rise of another branchofelectrical philosophy.

CHAPTEE III. GALVANISM, FROM GALVANI TO OHM.
UNTIL the last decade of the eighteenth century, electricianswere occupied solely with statical electricity. Their attentionwas then turned in a different direction. In a work entitled Recherches sur Vorigine des sentimentsagreables et cUsagrcables, which was published* in 1752,Johann Georg Sulzer (b. 1720, d. 1779) had mentioned that, if two pieces of metal, the one of lead and the other of silver, bejoined together in such a manner that their edges touch, and if they be placed on the tongue, a taste is perceived
" similar tothat of vitriol of iron," although neither of these metals appliedseparately gives any trace of such a taste.
" It is not probable,"he says,
" that this contact of the two metals causes a solutionof either of them, liberating particles which might affect thetongue : and we must therefore conclude that the contact setsup a vibration in their particles, which, by affecting the nervesof the tongue, produces the taste in question."
This observation was not suspected to have any connexionwith electrical phenomena, and it played no part in the inception of the next discovery, which indeed was suggested by amere accident. Luigi Galvani, born at Bologna in 1737, occupied from 1775onwards a chair of Anatomy in his native city. For many yearsbefore the event which made him famous he had been studyingthe susceptibility of -the nerves to irritation ; and, having been<-formerly a pupil of Beccaria, he was also interested in electrical experiments. One day in the latter part of the year 1780 he'had, as he tells us,f
" dissected and prepared a frog, and laid it on a table, on which, at some distance from the frog, was anelectric machine. It happened by chance that one of my* Mem. de 1'Acad. de Berlin, 1752, p. 356. t Aloysii Galvani, De Viribus E'lee trie itatis in Motu Mnsculari : CommentariiBononiensi, vii (1791), p. 363. F 2

assistants touched the inner crural nerve of the frog with thepoint of a scalpel ; whereupon at once the muscles of the limbswere violently convulsed.
" Another of those who used to help me in electrical experiments thought he had noticed that at this instant a spark wasdrawn from the conductor of the machine. I myself was at thetime occupied with a totally different matter; but when hedrew my attention to this, I greatly desired to try it for myself,.and discover its hidden principle. So I, too, touched one orother of the crural nerves with the point of the scalpel, at thesame time that one of those present drew a spark ; and the samephenomenon was repeated exactly as before."* After this, Galvani conceived the idea of trying whether theelectricity of thunderstorms would induce muscular contractionsequally well with the electricity of the machine. Havingsuccessfully experimented with lightning, he " wished," as hewrites,!
" to try the effect of atmospheric electricity in calmweather. My reason for this was an observation I had made,,that frogs which had been suitably prepared for these experiments and fastened, by brass hooks in the spinal marrow, tothe iron lattice round a certain hanging-garden at my house,,exhibited convulsions not only during thunderstorms, butsometimes even when the sky was quite serene. I suspectedthese effects to be due to the changes which take place duringthe day in the electric state of the atmosphere ; and so, withsome degree of confidence, I performed experiments to test thepoint; and at different hours for many days I watched frogswhich I had disposed for the purpose ; but could not detect anymotion in their muscles. At length, weary of waiting in vain,I pressed the brass hooks, which were driven into the spinalmarrow, against the iron lattice, in order to see whethercontractions could be excited by varying the incidental circum-* According to a story which has often been repeated, but which rests on nosufficient evidence, the frog was one of a number which had been procured for th&Signora Galvani, who, being in poor health, had been recommended to take a soup, made of these animals as a restorative. f Loc. cit., p. 377.

" However, at this time, when as yet I had not tried theexperiment except in the open air, I came very near to adopting a theory that the contractions are due to atmosphericelectricity, which, having slowly entered the animal and accu-mulated in it, is suddenly discharged when the hook comes incontact with the iron lattice. For it is easy in experimentingto deceive ourselves, and to imagine we see the things we wishto see.
" But I took the animal into a closed room, and placed it onan iron-plate ; and when I pressed the hook which was fixedin the spinal marrow against the plate, behold ! the samespasmodic contractions as before. I tried other metals atdifferent hours on various days, in several places, and alwayswith the same result, except that the contractions were moreviolent with some metals than with others. After this I triedvarious bodies which are not conductors of electricity, such asglass, gums, resins, stones, and dry wood ; but nothing happened.This was somewhat surprising, and led me to suspect thatelectricity is inherent in the animal itself. This suspicion wasstrengthened by the observation that a kind of circuit of subtlenervous fluid (resembling the electric circuit which is manifestedin the Leyclen jar experiment) is completed from the nerves tothe muscles when the contractions are produced.
" For, while I with one hand held the prepared frog by thehook fixed in its spinal marrow, so that it stood with its feeton a silver box, and with the other hand touched the lid ofthe box, or its sides, with any metallic body, I was surprisedto see the frog become strongly convulsed every time that Iapplied this artifice."* Galvani thus ascertained that the limbs of the frog are con-vulsed whenever a connexion is made between the nerves andmuscles by a metallic arc, generally formed of more than one*This observation was made in 1786.

kind of metal ; and he advanced the hypothesis that the convulsions are caused by the transport of a peculiar fluid from the' nerves to the muscles, the arc acting as a conductor. To thisfluid the names Galvanism and .Animal Electricity were soongenerally applied. Galvani himself considered it to be the sameas the ordinary electric fluid, and, indeed, regarded the entirephenomenon as similar to the discharge of a Leyden jar. *' The publication of Gralvani's views soon engaged the attentionof the learned world, and gave rise to an animated controversybetween those who supported Galvani's own view, those whobelieved galvanism to be a fluid distinct from ordinary electricity,and a third school who altogether refused to attribute the effectsto a supposed fluid contained in the nervous system. The leaderof the last-named party was Alessandro Volta (b. 1745, d. 1827),Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Pavia, whoin 1792 put forward the view* that the stimulus in Galvani'sexperiment is derived essentially from the connexion of twodifferent metals by a moist body. "The metals used in the* experiments, being applied to the moist bodies of animals, can bythemselves, and of their proper virtue, excite and dislodge theelectric fluid from its state of rest ; so that the organs of the* animal act only passively." At first he inclined to combine thistheory of metallic stimulus with a certain degree of belief insuch a fluid as Galvani had supposed; but after the end of 17!. '3he denied the existence of animal electricity altogether.
From this standpoint Volta continued his experiments andworked out his theory. The following quotation from a lettertwhich he wrote later to Gren, the editor of the Neucs Journal//. Physik, sets forth his view in a more developed form : "The contact of different conductors, particularly the metallic,including pyrites and other minerals, as well as charcoal, whichI call dry conductors, or of the first class, with moist conductors,or conductors of the second class, agitates or disturbs the electricf
fluid, or gives it a certain impulse. Do not ask in what manner: it is enough that it is a principle, and a general principle. This*Phil. Trans., 1793, pp. 10, 27. tPhil. Mag. iv (1799), pp. 59, 163, 306.
Galvanism , from Galvani to Okm. 71impulse, whether produced by attraction or any other force, is different or unlike, both in regard to the different metals and tothe different moist conductors ; so that the direction, or at leastthe power, with which the electric fluid is impelled or excited, is different when the conductor A is applied to the conductor B, orto another C. In a perfect circle of conductors, where eitherone of the second class is placed between two different from eachother of the first class, or, contrariwise, one of the first class is placed between two of the second class different from each other,an electric stream is occasioned by the predominating force eitherto the right or to the left a circulation of this fluid, which ceasesonly when the circle is broken, and which is renewed when thecircle is again rendered complete."
Another philosopher who, like Volta, denied the existence ofa fluid peculiar to animals, but who took a somewhat differentview of the origin of the phenomenon, was Giovanni Fabroni, ofFlorence (b. 1752, d. 1822), who,* having placed two plates ofdifferent metals in water, observed that one of them was partiallyoxidized when they were put in contact ; from which he rightlyconcluded that some chemical action is inseparably connectedwith galvanic effects. The feeble intensity of the phenomena of galvanism, whichcompared poorly with the striking displays obtained in electrostatics, was responsible for some falling off of interest in themtowards the end of the eighteenth century ; and the last yearsof their illustrious discoverer were clouded by misfortune. Beingattached to the old order which was overthrown by the armiesof the French Kevolution, he refused in 1798 to take the oath of allegiance to the newly constituted Cisalpine Eepublic, and wasdeposed from his professorial chair. A profound melancholy,which had been induced by domestic bereavement, was aggravated by poverty and disgrace ; and, unable to survive the loss of all he held dear, he died broken-hearted before the end of the year.f

72 Galvanism, Jrom Galvani to O/it/i.
Scarcely more than a year after the death of Galvani, thenew science suddenly regained
' the eager attention of philosophers. This renewal of interest was due to the discovery byVolta, in the early spring of 1800, of a means of greatly increasingthe intensity of the effects. Hitherto all attempts to magnifythe action by enlarging or multiplying the apparatus had endedin failure. If a long chain of different metals was used insteadof only two, the convulsions of the frog were no more violent.But Volta now showed* that if any number of couples, eachconsisting of a zinc disk and a copper disk in contact, were taken,and if each couple was separated from the next by a disk of moistened pasteboard (so that the order was copper, zinc, pasteboard,copper, zinc, pasteboard, &c.), the effect of the pile thus formedwas much greater than that of any galvanic apparatus previouslyintroduced. When the highest and lowest disks were simultaneously touched by the fingers, a distinct shock was felt ; andthis could be repeated again and again, the pile apparentlypossessing within itself an indefinite power of recuperation. Itthus resembled a Leyden jar endowed with a power of automatically re-establishing its state of tension after each explosion;with, in fact,
" an inexhaustible charge, a perpetual action orimpulsion on the electric fluid." Volta unhesitatingly pronounced the phenomena of the pileto be in their nature electrical. The circumstances of Galvani'soriginal discovery had prepared the minds of philosophers forthis belief, which was powerfully supported by the similarity ofthe physiological effects of the pile to those of the Leyden jar,and by the observation that the galvanic influence was conductedonly by those bodies e.g. the metals which were alreadyknown to be good conductors of static electricity. But Voltanow supplied a still more convincing proof. Taking a disk ofcopper and one of zinc, 'he held each by an insulating handleand applied them to each other for an instant. After the diskshad been separated, they were brought into contact with a deli-* I'hil. Trans., 1800, p. 403.

On the basis of this result Volta in the same year (1800)put forward a definite theory of the action of the pile. Supposefirst that a disk of zinc is laid on a disk of copper, which in turnrests on an insulating support. The experiment just describedshows that the electric fluid will be driven from the copper to the zinc. We may then, according to Volta, represent the state or
" tension
" of the copper by the number -
J, and that of thezinc by the number + J, the difference being arbitrarily taken as
unity, and the sum being (on account of the insulation) zero. It
will be seen that Volta's idea of " tension " was a mingling of two ideas, which in modern electric theory are clearly distin- guished from each other namely, electric charge and electric potential.
Now let a disk of moistened pasteboard be laid on the zinc,
and a disk of copper on this again. Since the uppermostcopper is not in contact with the zinc, the contact-action doesnot take place between them ; but since the moist pasteboard is a conductor, the copper will receive a charge from the zinc. Thus the states will now be represented by -
f
for the lowercopper, + J for the zinc, and + \ for the upper copper, giving azero sum as before.
If, now, another zinc disk is placed on the top, the states
will be represented by - 1 for the lower copper, for the lowerzinc and upper copper, and + 1 for the upper zinc. In this way it is evident that the difference between thenumbers indicating the tensions of the uppermost and lowest* Abraham Bennet (b. 1750, d. 1799) had previously shown (Xew Experiments
in Electricity, 1789, pp. 86-102) that many bodies, when separated after contact, fare oppositely electrified ; he conceived that different bodies have different attractions or capacities for electricity.
74 Galvanism , from Galvani to O/im.
disks in the pile will always be equal to the number of pairsofmetallic disks contained in it. If the pile is insulated, thesum of the numbers indicating the states of all the disks mustbe zero; but if the lowest disk is connected to earth, thetension of this disk will be zero, and the numbers indicating thestates of all the other disks will be increased by the sameamount, their mutual differences remaining unchanged.
The pile as a whole is thus similar to a Leyden jar; when the experimenter touches the uppermost and lowestdisks, he receives the shock of its discharge, the intensity beingproportional to the number of disks. The moist layers played no part in Volta's theory beyondj. that of conductors.* It was soon found that when the moistureis acidified, the pile is more efficient; but this was attributedsolely to the superior conducting power of acids. Yolta fully understood and explained the impossibilityofconstructing a pile from disks of metal alone, without makinguse of moist substances. As he showed in 1801, if disks ofvarious metals are placed in contact in any order, the extrememetals will be in the same state as if they touched each otherdirectly without the intervention of the others ; so that thewhole is equivalent merely to a single pair. When the metalsare arranged in the order silver, copper, iron, tin, lead, zinc,each of them becomes positive with respect to that whichprecedes it, and negative with respect to that which follows it; but the moving force from the silver to the zinc is equal to thesum of the moving forces of the metals comprehended betweenthem in the series. When a connexion was maintained for some time betweenthe extreme disks of a pile by the human body, sensationswere experienced which seemed to indicate a continuous activityin the entire system. Yolta inferred that the electric currentpersists during the whole time that communication by con-* Volta had inclined, in his earlier experiments on galvanism, to locate the seatof power at the interfaces of the metals with the rnoist conductors.

" This endless circulation or perpetual motion of the electric
fluid," he says, "may seem paradoxical, and may prove
inexplicable ; but it is none the less real, and we can, so to speak, touch and handle it." Yolta announced his discovery in a letter to Sir JosephBanks, dated from Como, March 20th, 1800. Sir Joseph, whowas then President of the Eoyal Society, communicated the news to William Nicholson (b. 1753, d. .1815), founder of the
Journal which is generally known by his name, and his friend Anthony Carlisle (b. 1768, d. 1840), afterwards a
distinguished surgeon. On the 30th of the following month,Nicholson and Carlisle set up the first pile made in England. In
repeating Volta's experiments, having made the contact moresecure at the upper plate of the pile by placing a drop of waterthere, they noticed* a disengagement of gas round the con- ducting wire at this point ; whereupon they followed up the
matter by introducing a tube of water, into which the wires
from the terminals of the pile were plunged. Bubbles of aninflammable gas were liberated at one wire, while the other
wire became oxidised ; when platinum wires were used, oxygenand hydrogen were evolved in a free state, one at each wire. This effect, which was nothing less than the electric decomposition of water into its constituent gases, was obtained onMay 2nd, 1800.f
Although it had long been known that frictional electricity
is capable of inducing chemical action,* the discovery of Nicholson and Carlisle was of the first magnitude. It was at once extended by William Cruickshank, of Woolwich (b. 1745,

He found that water could be decomvy posed by currents of either type, and inferred that all differencesbetween them could be explained by supposing that voltaicelectricity as commonly obtained is "
less intense, but producedin much, larger quantity." Later in the same year (1801),Martin van Marum (ft. 1750, d. 1837) and Christian HeinrichPfaff (ft. 1773, d. 1852) arrived at the same conclusionbycarrying out on a large scale} Volta's plan of using the piletoV charge batteries of Leyden jars.
The discovery of Nicholson and Carlisle made a greatimpression on the mind of Humphry Davy (ft. 1778, d. 1829),ayoung Cornishman who about this time was appointed Professorof Chemistry at the E-oyal Institution in London. Davy at oncebegan to experiment vvitli Voltaic piles, and in November, 1800,showed that they give no current when the water betweenthey pairs of plates is pure, and that their power of action is "ingreat measure proportional to the power of the conductingfluid substance between the double plates to oxydatethezinc." This result, as he immediately perceived, didnotharmonize well with Volta's views on the source of electricityin the pile, but was, on the other hand, in agreementwith, Eabroni's idea that galvanic effects are always accompaniedbychemical action. After a series of experiments he definitely1 concluded that " the galvanic pile of Volta acts only whentheconducting substance between the plates is capable of oxydatingthe zinc ; and that, in proportion as a greater quantityofoxygen enters into combination with the zinc in a given time,so in proportion is the power of the pile to decompose waterand to give the shock greater. It seems therefore reasonable* Nicholson's Journal (4to), iv (1800), pp. 187,245: Phil. Mag., vii (1800),p. 337. t Phil. Mag., 1801, p. 427. J Phil.

Galvanism, from Galvani (o Ohm. 77to conclude, though with our present quantity of facts we are unable to explain the exact mode of operation, that the </oxydatioii of the zinc in the pile, and the chemical changes
connected with it, are somehow the cause of the electrical effects ^it produces." This principle of oxidation guided Davy in designing many new types of pile, with elements chosen from
the whole range of the known metals. Davy's chemical theory of the pile was supported by
Wollaston* and by Nicholson,f the latter of whom urged that
the existence of piles in which only one metal is used (with more
than one kind of fluid) is fatal to any theory which places the
seat of the activity in the contact of dissimilar metals. Davy afterwards proposed J a theory of the voltaic pile
which combines ideas drawn from both the "contact" and
" chemical " explanations. Ho supposed that before the circuit
is closed, the copper and zinc disks in each contiguous pair assume opposite electrostatic states, in consequence of inherent
"electrical energies" possessed by the metals; and when a > communication is made between the extreme disks by a wire,
the opposite electricities annihilate each other, as in the dis- charge of a Leyden jar. If the liquid (which Davy compared
to the glass of a Leyden jar) were incapable of decomposition,
the current would cease after this discharge. But the liquid in the pile is composed of two elements which have inherent
attractions for electrified metallic surfaces : hence arises chemical action, which removes from the disks the outermost
layers of molecules, whose energy is exhausted, and exposes new metallic surfaces. The electrical energies of the copper and
zinc are consequently again exerted, and the process of electro- motion continues. Thus the contact of metals is the cause which disturbs the equilibrium, while the chemical changes
continually restore the conditions under which the contact energy can be exerted. In this and other memoirs Davy asserted that chemical

J affinity is essentially of an electrical nature.
" Chemical andelectrical attractions," he declared,* "are produced by thesame cause, acting in one case on particles, in the otheronmasses, of matter; and the same property, under differentmodifications, is the cause of all the phenomena exhibitedbydifferent voltaic combinations."
The further elucidation of this matter came chiefly from- researches on electro-chemical decomposition, which we mustnow consider. A phenomenon which had greatly surprised Nicholson andCarlisle in their early experiments was the appearanceofthe products of galvanic decomposition at places remote fromeach other. The first attempt to account for this was madein1806 by Theodor von Grothussf (b. 1785, d. 1822) and by Davy,}who advanced a theory that the terminals at which waterisdecomposed have attractive and repellent powers ; that the polewhence resinous electricity issues has the property of attractinghydrogen and the metals, and of repelling oxygen and acidsubstances, while the positive terminal has the power of attract-ing oxygen and repelling hydrogen ; and that these forces aresufficiently energetic to destroy or suspend the usual operationof chemical affinity in the water-molecules nearest theterminals. The force due to each terminal was supposedtodiminish with the distance from the terminal. Whenthemolecule nearest one of the terminals has been decomposedbythe attractive and repellent forces of the terminal, one of itsconstituents is liberated there, while the other constituent, byvirtue of electrical forces (the oxygen and hydrogen beinginopposite electrical states), attacks the next molecule, whichis then decomposed. The surplus constituent from this attacksthe next molecule, and so on. Thus a chain of decompositionsand recompositions was supposed to be set up amongthemolecules intervening between the terminals.

Galvanism^ from ^Galvani to Ohm. 79The hypothesis of Grothuss and Davy was attacked in 1825
by Aiiguste De La Kive* (6. 1801, d. 1873) of Geneva, on the
ground of its failure to explain what happens when different liquids are placed in series in the circuit. If, for example, a
solution of zinc sulphate is placed in one compartment, andwater in another, and if the positive pole is placed in the
solution of zinc sulphate, and the negative pole in the water,
De La Rive found that oxide of zinc is developed round the
latter; although decomposition and recomposition of zinc sulphate could not take place in the water, which contained none of it. Accordingly, he supposed the constituents of the
decomposed liquid to be bodily transported across the liquids, in close union with the moving electricity. In the electrolysis of water, one current of electrified hydrogen was supposed to leave the positive pole, and become decomposed into hydrogenand electricity at the negative pole, the hydrogen being
there liberated as a gas. Another current in the same waycarried electrified oxygen from the negative to the positive
pole. In this scheme the chain of successive decompositions
imagined by Grothuss does not take place, the only molecules
decomposed being those adjacent to the poles.
The appearance of the products of decomposition at the
separate poles could be explained either in Grothuss' fashion
by assuming dissociations throughout the mass of liquid, or
in De La Rive's by supposing particular dissociated atomsto travel considerable distances. Perhaps a preconceived
idea of economy in Nature deterred the workers of that time
from accepting the two assumptions together, when either of them separately would meet the case. Yet it is to this apparentredundancy that later researches have pointed as the truth. Nature is what she is, and not what we would make her. De La Rive was one of the most thoroughgoing opponentsof Volta's contact theory of the pile ; even in the case whentwo metals are in contact in air only, without the intervention

80 Galvanism, from Galvani to Ohm.
of any liquid, he attributed the electric effect wholly to thechemical affinity of the air for the metals. During the long interval between the publication of the rivalhypotheses of Grothuss and De La Bive, little real progresswas made with the special problems of the cell ; but meanwhile electric theory was developing in other directions. Oneof these, to which our attention will first be turned, was theelectro-chemical theory of the celebrated Swedish chemist,Jons Jacob Berzelius (b. 1779, d. 1848).
Berzelius founded his theory,* which had been in one or twoof its features anticipated by Davy,f on inferences drawn fromVolta's contact effects. " Two bodies," he remarked,
" whichhave affinity for each other, and which have been brought intomutual contact, are found upon separation to be in oppositeelectrical states. That which has the greatest affinity foroxygen usually becomes positively electrified, and the othernegatively."
This seemed to him to indicate that chemical affinity arisesfrom the play of electric forces, which in turn spring fromelectric charges within the atoms of matter. To be precise,he supposed each atom to possess two poles, which are theseat of opposite electrifications, and whose electrostatic field isthe cause of chemical affinity.
By aid of this conception Berzelius drew a simple and vividpicture of chemical combination. Two atoms, which are aboutto unite, dispose themselves so that the positive pole of onetouches the negative pole of the other ; the electricities of thesetwo poles then discharge each other, giving rise to the heat andlight which are observed to accompany the act of combination.!The disappearance of these leaves the compound molecule withthe two remaining poles ; and it cannot be dissociated into itsconstituent atoms again until some means is found of restoringto the vanished poles their charges. Such a means is afforded* Memoirs of the Acad. of Stockholm, 1812 ; Nicholson's Journal of Nat. Phil.,xxxiv (1813), 142, 153, 240, 319; xxxv, 38, 118, 159. t Pnil. Trans., 1807. J This idea was Davy's.
Galvanism, from Gaivani to Ohm. 81by the action of the galvanic pile in electrolysis : the opposite
electricities of the current invade the molecules of the
electrolyte, and restore the atoms to their original state of polarization.
If, as Berzelius taught, all chemical compounds are formedby the mutual neutralization of pairs of atoms, it is evident/that they must have a binary character. Thus he conceived asalt to be compounded of an acid and an oxide, and each of these to be compounded of two other constituents. Moreover,in any compound the electropositive member would be replaceable only by another electropositive member, and the electro- negative member only by another member also electronegative ; so that the substitution of, e.g., chlorine for hydrogen in acompound would be impossible an inference which wasoverthrown by subsequent discoveries in chemistry.
Berzelius succeeded in bringing the most curiously diverse
facts within the scope of his theory. Thus " the combination1 of polarized atoms requires a motion to turn the oppositepoles to each other; and to this circumstance is owing thefacility with which combination takes place when one of thetwo bodies is in the liquid state, or when both are in that
state ; and the extreme difficulty, or nearly impossibility, of
effecting an union between bodies, both of which are solid. And again, since each polarized particle must have an electric atmosphere, and as this atmosphere is the predisposing cause of combination, as we have seen, it follows, that the particles
cannot act but at certain distances, proportioned to theintensity of their polarity ; and hence it is that bodies, whichhave affinity for each other, always combine nearly on theinstant when mixed in the liquid state, but less easily in thegaseous state, and the union ceases to be possible under acertain degree of dilatation of the gases ; as we know by theexperiments of Grothuss, that a mixture of oxygen andhydrogen in due proportions, when rarefied to a certain
degree, cannot be set on fire at any temperature whatever."j And again : " Many bodies require an elevation of temperature to G

enable them to act upon each other. It appears, therefore,that heat possesses the property of augmenting the polarity ofthese bodies." Berzelius accounted for Volta's electromotive series byassuming the electrification at one pole of an atom to be some-what more or somewhat less than what would be requiredtoneutralize the charge at the other pole. Thus each atom wouldpossess a certain net or residual charge, which might beofeither sign ; and the order of the elements in Volta's seriescould be interpreted simply as the order in which they wouldstand when ranged according to the magnitude of this residualcharge. As we shall see, this conception was afterwardsoverthrown by Faraday.
Berzelius permitted himself to publish some speculations onthe nature of heat and electricity, which bring vividly beforeus the outlook of an able thinker in the first quarter of thenineteenth century. The great question, he says, is whetherv the electricities and caloric are matter or merely phenomena.If the title of matter is to be granted only to such things asare ponderable, then these problematic entities are certainlynot matter ; but thus to narrow the application of the termis,he believes, a mistake; and he inclines to the opinion thatcaloric is truly matter, possessing chemical affinities withoutobeying the law of gravitation, and that light and all radiationsconsist in modes of propagating such matter. This conclusionmakes it easier to decide regarding electricity.
" Fromthe relation which exists between caloric and the electricities,"he remarks, "it is clear that what may be true with regardto the materiality of one of them must also be true withregard to that of the other. There are, however, a quantityof phenomena produced by electricity which do not admitofexplanation without admitting at the same time that electricityis matter. Electricity, for instance, very often detacheseverything which covers the surface of those bodies whichconduct it. It, indeed, passes through conductors withoutleaving any trace of its passage ; but it penetrates non-con-
Galvanism i from Galvani to Ohm. 83ductors which oppose its course, and makes a perforation
precisely of the same description as would have been madeby something which had need of place for its passage. Weoften observe this when electric jars are broken by an overcharge, or when the electric shock is passed through a numberof cards, etc. We may therefore, at least with some probability, imagine caloric and the electricities to be matter,
destitute of gravitation, but possessing affinity to gravitating
bodies. When they are not confined by these affinities, theytend to place themselves in equilibrium in the universe. The^suns destroy at every moment this equilibrium, and they sendthe re-united electricities in the form of luminous rays towardsthe planetary bodies, upon the surface of which the rays, beingarrested, manifest themselves as caloric ; and this last in its turn, during the time required to replace it in equilibrium in the universe, supports the chemical activity of organic andinorganic nature."
It was scarcely to be expected that anything so speculative
as Berzelius' electric conception of chemical combinationwould be confirmed in all particulars by subsequent discovery ; and, as a matter of fact, it did not as a coherent theory survivethe lifetime of its author. But some of its ideas havepersisted, and among them the conviction which lies at its foundation, that chemical affinities are, in the last resort, of * electrical origin.
While the attention of chemists was for long directed to the theory of Berzelius, the interest of electricians wasdiverted from it by a discovery of the first magnitude in a
different region.
That a relation of some land subsists between electricity
and magnetism had been suspected by the philosophers of the
eighteenth century. The suspicion was based in part on somecurious effects produced by lightning, of a kind which may be
illustrated by a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions
in 1735.* A tradesman of Wakefield, we are told, "having put*Phil. Trans, xxxix (1735), p. 74. G 2

up a great number of knives and forks in a large box, andhaving placed the box in the corner of a large room, therehappen'd in July, 1731, a sudden storm of thunder, lightning,etc., by which the corner of the room was damaged, the Boxsplit, and a good many knives and forks melted, the sheathsbeing untouched. The owner emptying the box upon a Counterwhere some Nails lay, the Persons who took up the knives, thatlay upon the Nails, observed that the knives took up the Nails."Lightning thus came to be credited with the powerofmagnetizing steel ; and it was doubtless this which led Franklin*in 1751 to attempt to magnetize a sewing-needle by meansofthe discharge of Leyden jars. The attempt was indeed successful ; but, as Van Marum afterwards showed, it was doubtfulwhether the magnetism was due directly to the current. More experiments followed.f In 1805 Jean Nicholas PierreHachette (b. 1769, d. 1834) and Charles Bernard Desormes(b. 1777, d. 1862) attempted to determine whether an insulatedvoltaic pile, freely suspended, is oriented by terrestrial magnetism ; bat without positive result. In 1807 Hans ChristianOersted (&. 1777, d. 1851), Professor of Natural Philosophy inCopenhagen, announced his intention of examining the actionof electricity on the magnetic needle ; but it was not for someyears that his hopes were realized. If one of his pupils is to bebelieved,* he was " a man of genius, but a very unhappy experimenter ; he could not manipulate instruments. He mustalways have an assistant, or one of his auditors who had easyhands, .to arrange the experiment."
During a course of lectures which he delivered in the winterof 1819-20 on
" Electricity, Galvanism, and Magnetism," theidea occurred to him that the changes observed with thecompass-needle during a thunderstorm might give the clue tothe effect of which he was in search ; and this led him to thinkthat the experiment should be tried with the galvanic circuit* Letter vi from Franklin to Collinson. f In 1774 the Electoral Academyof Bavaria proposed the question, " Is there a real and physical analogy betweenelectric and magnetic forces ? "

At first he placed thewire at right angles to the needle, but observed no result. After the end of a lecture in which this negative experimenthad been shown, the idea occurred to him to place the wireparallel to the needle : on trying it, a pronounced deflexion wasobserved, and the relation between magnetism and the electric current was discovered. After confirmatory experiments withmore powerful apparatus, the public announcement was madein July, 1820 * Oersted did not determine the quantitative laws of the;action, but contented himself with a statement of the qualitative effect and some remarks on its cause, which recall themagnetic speculations of Descartes : indeed, Oersted's conceptions may be regarded as linking those of the Cartesian schoolto those which were introduced subsequently by Faraday.
" Tothe effect which takes place in the conductor and in the sur- rounding space," he wrote,
" we shall give the name of the-conflict of electricity?
" The electric conflict acts only on themagnetic particles of matter. All non-magnetic bodies appearpenetrable by the electric conflict, while magnetic bodies, orrather their magnetic particles, resist the passage of this conflict Hence they can be moved by the impetus of the contendingpowers.
" It is sufficiently evident from the preceding facts that theelectric conflict is not confined to the conductor, but dispersedpretty widely in the circumjacent space.
" From the preceding facts we may likewise collect, that thisconflict performs circles ; for without this condition, it seemsimpossible that the one part of the uniting wire, when placedbelow the magnetic pole, should drive it toward the east, andwhen placed above it toward the west; for it is the nature of a* Schweigger's Journal fur Chemie und Physik, zxix (1820), p. 275 ; Thomson'sAnnals of Philosophy, xvi (1820), p. 273; Ostwald's Klattiter der

circle that the motions in opposite parts should have an opposite1 direction." Oersted's discovery was described at the meeting of theFrench Academy on September llth, 1820, by an academician(Arago) who had just returned from abroad. Several investi-gators in France repeated and extended his experiments ; andthe first precise analysis of the effect was published by twoofthese, Jean-Baptiste Biot (b. 1774, d. 1862) and Felix Savart(b. 1791, d. 1841), who, at a meeting of the Academy of Scienceson October 30th, 1820, announced* that the action experiencedby a pole of austral or boreal magnetism, when placed at anydistance from a straight wire carrying a voltaic current, maybe4
thus expressed : " Draw from the pole a perpiendicular to thewire ; the force on the pole is at right angles to this line andtathe wire, and its intensity is proportional to the reciprocal ofthe distance." This result was soon further analysed, theattractive force being divided into constituents, each of whichwas supposed to be due to some particular element of thecurrent ; in its new form the law may be stated thus : the-magnetic force due to an element ds of a circuit, in whichacurrent i is flowing, at a point whose vector distance from ds is r,,is (in suitable units)

It was now recognized that a magnetic field may be producedas readily by an electric current as by a magnet ; and, as Aragosoon showed, this, like any other magnetic field, is capableof* Annales de Chimie, xv (1820), p. 222 ; Journal de Phys., xli, p. 51. f If a and b denote two vectors, the vector whose components are (aybz azby ^azb* a*bz , axby aybx) is called the vector product of a and b, and is denoted by[a, b].

The question naturally suggested itself as to whether the similarity of properties betweencurrents and magnets extended still further, e.g. whetherconductors carrying currents would, like magnets, experienceponderomotive forces when placed in a magnetic field, andwhether such conductors would consequently, like magnets,exert ponderomotive forces on each other. The first step towards answering these inquiries was takenby Oersted* himself. " As," he said,
" a body cannot putanother in motion without being moved in its turn, when it possesses the requisite mobility, it is easy to foresee that thegalvanic arc must be moved by the magnet
"
; and this heverified experimentally.
The next step came from Andre Marie Ampere (b. 1775,d. 1836), who at the meeting of the Academy on September 18th,exactly a week after the news of Oersted's first discovery hadarrived, showed that two parallel wires carrying currentsattract each other if the currents are in the same direction,and repel each other if the currents are in opposite directions.During the next three years Ampere continued to prosecutethe researches thus inaugurated, and in 1825 published hiscollected results in one of the most celebrated memoirsf in thehistory of natural philosophy.
Ampere introduces his work by proclaiming himself afollower of that school which explained all physical phenomenain terms of equal and oppositely directed forces between pairsof particles ; and he renounces the attempt to seek morespeculative, though possibly more fundamental, explanationsin terms of the motions of ultimate fluids and aethers. Nevertheless, he indicates two conceptions of this latter character, onwhich such explanations might be founded.
In the firstj he suggests that the ponderomotive forces*

between circuits carrying electric currents may be due to " thereaction of the elastic fluid which extends throughout allspace, whose vibrations produce the phenomena of light," andwhich is " put in motion by electric currents." This fluid oraether can, he says,
" be no other than that which results fromthe combination of the two electricities/'
In the second conception,* Ampere suggests that theinterspaces between the metallic molecules of a wire whichcarries a current may be occupied by a fluid composed of thetwo electricities, not in the proportions which form the neutralfluid, but with an excess of that one of them which is oppositeto the electricity peculiar to the molecules of the metal, andwhich consequently masks this latter electricity. In this inter-molecular fluid the opposite electricities are continually beingdissociated and recombined ; a dissociation of the fluid withinone inter-molecular interval having taken place, the positiveelectricity thus produced unites with the negative electricityof the interval next to it in the direction of the current, whilethe negative electricity of the first interval unites with thepositive electricity of the next interval in the other direction.Such interchanges, according to this hypothesis, constitute theelectric current. Ampere's memoir is, however, but little occupied with themore speculative side of the subject. His first aim wastoinvestigate thoroughly by experiment the ponderomotive forceson electric currents.
" When," he remarks,
" M. Oersted discovered the actionwhich a current exercises on a magnet, one might certainly havesuspected the existence of a mutual action between two circuitscarrying currents ; but this was not a necessary consequence; for a bar of soft iron also acts on a magnetized needle, althoughthere is no mutual action between two bars of soft iron." Ampere, therefore, submitted the matter to the test of thelaboratory, and discovered that circuits carrying electriccurrents exert ponderomotive forces on each other, and that* Recucil d'observations electro-dunamiques, pp. 297, 300, 371.
Galvanism, from Gaivani to Ohm. 89
ponderomotive forces are exerted on such currents by magnets.
To the science which deals with the mutual action of currents he gave the name electro-dynamics ;* and he showed that the
action obeys the following laws : (1) The effect of a current is reversed when the direction of the current is reversed.
(2) The effect of a current flowing in a circuit twisted into small sinuosities is the same as if the circuit were smoothed out.
(3) The force exerted by a closed, circuit on an element of another circuit is at right angles to the latter. (4) The force between two elements of circuits is unaffected
when all linear dimensions are increased proportionately, the
current-strengths remaining unaltered. From these data, together with his assumption that the force between two elements of circuits acts along the line joining them,
Ampere obtained an expression of this force : the deduction maybe made in the following way : Let ds, ds' be the elements, r the line joining them, and i, i' the current-strengths. From (2) we see that the effect of ds on
ds' is the vector sum of the effects of dx, dy, dz on ds', where
these are the three components of ds: so the required force must be of the form
r x a scalar quantity which is linear and homogeneous in ds ; and it must similarly be linear and homogeneous in ds' ; so using (1), we see that the force must be of the form
F = ill | (ds . ds') 4> (r) + (ds . r) (ds'. r) i/, (r)} , where < and i// denote undetermined functions of r. From (4) it follows that when ds, ds', r are all multiplied by
the same number, F is unaffected : this shows that
4>(r) = - and f(r) = - , where A and B denote constants. Thus we have
, M(ds.ds') (ds.r)(ds'. r)) F = n r \ + - - ; ( r

Now, by (3), the resolved part of F along ds' must vanish whenintegrated round the circuit s, i.e. it must be a completedifferential when dr is taken to be equal to - ds. That is to-say, ^(ds.ds')(r.ds') (ds . r) (ds'. r)

Thus finally we have
F = Constant x ii'i || (ds . ds') - -
5 (ds . r)(ds'. r)
This is Ampere's formula : the multiplicative constant dependsof course on the units chosen, and may be taken to be - 1. The weakness of Ampere's work evidently lies in theassumption that the force is directed along the line joining the-two elements : for in the analogous case of the action betweentwo magnetic molecules, we know that the force is not directedalong the line joining the molecules. It is therefore of interestto find the form of F when this restriction is removed.
For this purpose we observe that we can add to the expressionalready found for F any term of the form
0(r) . (ds . r) . ds', where 0(r) denotes any arbitrary function of r ; for since
this term vanishes when integrated round the circuit s ; andit
Galvanism, from Galvani to Ohm. 91contains ds and ds' linearly and homogeneously, as it should. We can also add any terms of the form
rf{r..(ds'.r). x(r)|,
where \(r] denotes any arbitrary function of r, and d denotes
differentiation along the arc s, keeping ds' fixed (so that
dr = -
ds) ; this differential may be written - ds . (ds'. r) . x(r) - rx(r) (ds'. ds) -
* x'( r) r (ds . r) (ds'. r). In order that the law of Action and Eeaction may not be
violated, we must combine this with the former additional term
so as to obtain an expression symmetrical in ds and ds' : andhence we see finally that the general value of F is given by the equation
F = -n'rj j|(ds.ds')-J(ds.r)(ds.r)j + x(-; (ds' . r) ds + x(r) (ds . r) . ds' + x(r) (ds . ds')r + ix'(r)(ds.r)(ds'.r)r.
The simplest form of this expression is obtained by taking
when we obtain
/ F = - {(ds . r) . ds' + (ds'. r)ds - (ds . ds')r} . The comparatively simple expression in brackets is the
vector part of the quaternion product of the three vectors
ds, r, ds'.* From any of these values of F we can find the ponderomotive
force exerted by the whole circuit s on the element ds' : it is, in
fact, from the last expression,

where B = Now this value of B is precisely the value found by Biot andSavart* for the" magnetic intensity at ds' due to the- current i inthe circuit s. Thus we see that the ponderomotive force onacurrent-element ds' in a magnetic field B is i' [ds'. B].
Ampere developed to a considerable extent the theoryof the equivalence of magnets with circuits carrying currents;and showed that an electric current is equivalent, in itsmagnetic effects, to a distribution of magnetism on anysurface terminated by the circuit, the axes of the magneticmolecules being everywhere normal to this surface :f suchamagnetized surface is called a mayiwtic shell. He preferred,I however, to regard the current rather than the magnetic fluidas the fundamental entity, and considered magnetism to bereally an electrical phenomenon : each magnetic molecule owesits properties, according to this view, to the presence withinit/ of a small closed circuit in which an electric currentisperpetually flowing.
The impression produced by Ampere's memoir was greatand lasting. Writing half a century afterwards, Maxwellspeaks of it as
" one of the most brilliant achievementsinscience." " The whole," he says,
" theory and experiment,seems as if it had leaped, full-grown and full-armed, fromthebrain of the ' Newton of electricity/ It is perfect in formandunassailable in accuracy ; and it is summed up in a formulafrom which all the phenomena may be deduced, and whichmust always remain the cardinal formula of electrodynamics."Not long after the discovery by Oersted of the connexionbetween galvanism and magnetism, a connexion was discoveredbetween galvanism and heat.| In 1822 Thomas Johann Seebeck* See ante, p. 86. t Loc. cit., p. 367.
Galvanism, from ^Galvani to Ohm. 93(b. 1770, d. 1831), of Berlin discovered* that an electric current can be set up in a circuit of metals, without the interposition
of any liquid, merely by disturbing the equilibrium of temperature. Let a ring be formed of copper and bismuthsoldered together at the two extremities; to establish a current it is only necessary to heat the ring at one of these
junctions. To this new class of circuits the name thermoelectric was given.
It was found that the metals can be arranged as a
thermo-electric series, in the order of their power of generating
currents when thus paired, and that this order is quite different from Volta's order of electromotive potency. Indeed antimonyand bismuth, which are near each other in the latter series, are
at opposite extremities of the former.
The currents generated by thermo-electric means are generally feeble : and the mention of this fact brings us to the question, which was about this time engaging attention, of the efficacy of different voltaic arrangements.
Comparisons of a rough kind had been instituted soon after the discovery of the pile. The French chemists AntoineFranQois de Fourcroy (b. 1755, d. 1809), Louis McolasYauquelin (b. 1763, d. 1829), and Louis Jacques Thenard(b. 1777, d. 1857) foundf in 1801, on varying the size of themetallic disks constituting the pile, that the sensations
produced on the human frame were unaffected so long as thenumber of disks remained the same; but that the power 'of burning finely drawn wire was altered; and that the latter power was proportional to the total surface of the disks
employed, whether this were distributed among a small numberof large disks, or a large number of small ones. This was* Abhandl. d. Berlin Akad. 1822-3 ; Ann. d. Phys. Ixxiii (1823), pp. 115, 430 ; vi (1826), pp. 1, 133, 253. Volta had previously noticed that a silver plate whose ends were at different temperatures appeared to act like a voltaic cell. Further experiments were performed by James Gumming (. 1777, d. 1861), Professor of Chemistry at Cambridge, Trans. Camb. Phil. Soc. ii (1823), p. 47, and by Antoine Cesar Becquerel (b. 1788, d. 1878), Annales de Chimie, xxxi

explained by supposing that small plates give a small quantityof the electric fluid with a high velocity, while large platesgive a larger quantity with no greater velocity. Shocks,which were supposed to depend on the velocity of the fluidalone, would therefore not be intensified by increasing the sizeof the plates.
The effect of varying the conductors which connect theterminals of the pile was also studied. Nicolas Grautherot(b. 1753, d. 1803) observed* that water contained in tubes whichhave a narrow opening does not conduct voltaic currentssowell as when the opening is more considerable. This experiment is evidently very similar to that which Beccaria hadperformed half a century previously! with electrostaticdischarges.
As we have already seen, Cavendish investigated very-completely the power of metals to conduct electrostaticdischarges; their power of conducting voltaic currents wasnow examined by Davy.J His method was to connect theterminals of a voltaic battery by a path containing water(which it decomposed), and also by an alternative pathconsisting of the metallic wire under examination. Whenthelength of the wire was less than a certain quantity, the waterceased to be decomposed ; Davy measured the lengths andweights of wires of different materials and cross-sections underthese limiting circumstances ; and, by comparing them, showedthat the conducting power of a wire formed of any one metalis inversely proportional to its length and directly proportionalto its sectional area, but independent of the shape of the cross-section.! The latter fact, as he remarked, showed that voltaiccurrents pass through the substance of the conductor and notalong its surface. Davy, in the same memoir, compared the conductivitiesofvarious metals, and studied the effect of temperature : he found* Annales de China., xxxix (1801), p. 203. t See p. 53.% Phil. Trans., 1821, p. 433. His results were confirmed afterwards byBecquerel, Annales de Chiiuie, xxxii (1825), p. 423.
6 These results had been known to Cavendish.
Galvanism, from Galvani to Ohm. 95that the conductivity varied with the temperature, being
" lower in some inverse ratio as the temperature was higher."
He also observed that the same magnetic power is exhibited
by every part of the same circuit, even though it be formed
of wires of different conducting powers pieced into a chain, so that " the magnetism seems directly as the quantity of
electricity which they transmit."
The current which flows in a given voltaic circuit evidently
depends not only on the conductors which form the circuit,
but also on the driving-power of the battery. In order to forma complete theory of voltaic circuits, it was therefore necessary
to extend Davy's laws by taking the driving-power into account. This advance was effected in 1826 by Georg SimomOhm* (b. 1787, d. 1854).
Ohm had already carried out a considerable amount of experimental work on the subject, and had, e.g., discovered that
if a number of voltaic cells are placed in series in a circuit, the current is proportional to their number if the external
resistance is very large, but is independent of their number if the external resistance is small. He now essayed the task
of combining all the known results into a consistent theory.
For this purpose he adopted the idea of comparing the flow
of electricity in a current to the flow of heat along a wire, the
theory of which had been familiar to all physicists since the
publication of Fourier's Theorie analytique de la chcdeur in
1822. " I have proceeded," he says,
" from the supposition that
the communication of the electricity from one particle takes
place directly only to the one next to it, so that no immediatetransition from that particle to any other situate at a greater
distance occurs. The magnitude of the flow between twoadjacent particles, under otherwise exactly similar circumstances, I have assumed to be proportional to the difference of *Ann. d.

the electric forces existing in the two particles ; just as, in thetheory of heat, the flow of caloric between two particlesisregarded as proportional to the difference of their temperatures."''*' The comparison between the flow of electricity and the flowof heat suggested the propriety of introducing a quantitywhose behaviour in electrical problems should resemble thatoftemperature in the theory of heat. The differences in thevalues of such a quantity at two points of a circuit wouldprovide what was so much needed, namely, a measure of the"driving-power" acting on the electricity between thesepoints. To carry out this idea, Ohm recurred to Volta's theoryof the electrostatic condition of the open pile. It was cus-tomary to measure the " tension
" of a pile by connecting oneterminal to earth and testing the other terminal byanelectroscope. Accordingly Ohm says : " In order to investigatethe changes which occur in the electric condition of a bodyAin a perfectly definite manner, the body is each time brought,under similar circumstances, into relation with a secondmoveable body of invariable electrical condition, called theelectroscope ; and the force with which the electroscopeisrepelled or attracted by the body is determined. This forceistermed the electroscopic force of the body A"
" The same body A may also serve to determine the electro-scopic force in various parts of the same body. For thispurpose take the body A of very small dimensions, so thatwhen we bring it into contact with the part to be tested of anythird body, it may from its smallness be regarded as a substitutefor this part : then its electroscopic force, measured in the waydescribed, will, when it happens to be different at the variousplaces, make known the relative differences with regardtoelectricity between these places."
Ohm assumed, as was customary at that period, that whentwo metals are placed in contact,
" they constantly maintainatthe point of contact the same difference between their electro-scopic forces." He accordingly supposed that each voltaic cellpossesses a definite tension, or discontinuity of electroscopic
Galvanism, from Galvani to Ohm. 97force, which is to be regarded as its contribution to the drivingforce of any circuit in which it may be placed. This assumption
confers a definite meaning on his use of the term " electroscopic force
"
; the force in question is identical with the electrostatic potential. But Ohm and his contemporaries did not correctly
understand the relation of galvanic conceptions to the
j electrostatic functions of Poisson. The electroscopic force in the open pile was generally identified with the thickness
of the electrical stratum at the place tested ; while Ohm,recognizing that electric currents are not confined to the
surface of the conductors, but penetrate their substance, seems to have thought of the electroscopic force at a place in a circuit as being proportional to the volume-density of
electricity there an idea in which he was confirmed by the
relation which, in an analogous case, exists between the
temperature of a body and the volume-density of heatsupposed to be contained in it. Denoting, then, by S the current which flows in a wire of conductivity y, when the difference of the electroscopic forces at the terminals is E, Ohm writes
S =
yE.
From this formula it is easy to deduce the laws already given
by Davy. Thus, if the area of the cross-section of a wireis Ay we can by placing n such wires side by side construct
a wire of cross-section nA. If the quantity E is the samefor each, equal currents will flow in the wires ; and therefore
the current in the compound wire will be ?i times that in the single wire ; so when the quantity E is unchanged, the
current is proportional to the cross-section; that is, the
conductivity of a wire is directly proportional to its cross-section,
which is one of Davy's laws. In spite of the confusion which was attached to the idea of electroscopic force, and which was not dispelled for some years, the publication of Ohm's memoir marked a great advancein electrical philosophy. It was now clearly understood that
the current flowing in any conductor depends only on theH

conductivity inherent in the conductor and on another variablewhich bears to electricity the same relation that temperaturebears to heat ; and, moreover, it was realized that this lattervariable is the link connecting the theory of currents withthe older theory of electrostatics. These principles wereasufficient foundation for future progress; and much of thework which was published in the second quarter of the centurywas no more than the natural development of- the principleslaid down by Ohm.*
It is painful to relate that the discoverer had long to waitbefore the merits of his great achievement were officiallyrecognized. Twenty-two years after the publication of thememoir on the galvanic circuit, he was promoted to a universityprofessorship ; this he held for the five years which remaineduntil his death in 1854.
* Ohm's theory was confirmed experimentally by several investigators, amongwhom may be mentioned Gustav Theodor Feehner(i. 1801, d. 1887) (Maassbestim-mungen iiber die Galvanische Kette, Leipzig, 1831), and Charles Wheatstone(b. 1802, d. 1875) (Phil. Trans,, 1843, p. 303).
CHAPTER IV.
THE LUMINIFEROUS MEDIUM, FROM BRADLEY TO FRESNEL.
ALTHOUGH Newton, as we have seen, refrained from committinghimself to any doctrine regarding the ultimate nature of light,
the writers of the next generation interpreted his criticism of the wave-theory as equivalent to an acceptance of thecorpuscular hypothesis. As it happened, the chief optical
discovery of this period tended to support the latter theory,by which it was first and most readily explained. In 1728James Bradley (b. 1692, d. 1762), at that time SavilianProfessor of Astronomy at Oxford, sent to the AstronomerRoyal (Halley) an
" Account of a new discovered motion of theFix'd Stars."* In observing the star y in the head of theDragon, he had found that during the winter of 1725-6 thetransit across the meridian was continually more southerly,while during the following summer its original position wasrestored by a motion northwards. Such an effect could not beexplained as a result of parallax ; and eventually Bradleyguessed it to be due to the gradual propagation of light.f
Thus, let CA denote a ray of light, falling on the line BA; and suppose that the eye of the observer is travelling ^
along BA, with a velocity which is to the velocity
of light as BA is to CA. Then the corpuscle of
light, by which the object is discernible to the eye
at A, would have been at C when the eye was at B. The tube of a telescope must therefore be pointed
in the direction BC, in order to receive the rays
from an object whose light is really propagated in the direction CA. The angle BCA measures the
difference between the real and apparent positions
of the object ; and it is evident from the figure that the sine ofPhil. Trans, xxxv (1728), p. 637. t Roemer, in a letter to Huygens of date 30th Dec., 1677, mentions a suspected
displacement of the apparent position of a star, due to the motion of the earth at right angles to the line of sight. Cf. Correspondance de Huygens, viii, p. 53. H 2
100 The Lumini/erous Medium,
this angle is to the sine of the visible inclination of the objectto the line in which the eye is moving, as the velocity of the eyeis to the velocity of light. Observations such as Bradley's willtherefore enable us to deduce the ratio of the mean orbitalvelocity of the earth to the velocity of light, or, as it is called,.the constant of'aberration ; from its value Bradley calculated thatlight is propagated from the sun to the earth in 8 minutes12 seconds, which, as he remarked, "is as it were a Meanbetwixt what had at different times been determined from theeclipses of Jupiter's satellites."* With the exception of Bradley's discovery, which wasprimarily astronomical rather than optical, the eighteenthcentury was decidedly barren, as regards both the experimentaland the theoretical investigation of light ; in curious contrastto the brilliance of its record in respect of electrical researches.But some attention must be given to a suggestive studyf of theaether, for which the younger John Bernoulli (b. 1710, d. 1790)was in 1736 awarded the prize of the French Academy. Hisideas seem to have been originally suggested by an attempt};*Struve in 1845 found for the constant of aberration the value 20"'445, whichlie afterwards corrected to 20"'463. This was superseded in 1883 by the value20"-492, determined by M. Nyren. The observations of both Struve and Nyrenwere made with the transit in the prime vertical. The method now generallyused depends on the measurement of differences of meridian zenith distances(Talcott's method, as applied by F. Kiistner, Beobachtungs-Ergebnisse der kon.Sternwarte zu Berlin, Heft 3, 1888) ; the value at present favoured for theconstant of aberration is 20"-523. Cf. Chandler, Ast. Journal, xxiii, pp. 1, 12(1903). The collective translatory motion of the solar system gives rise to aberrational:terms in the apparent places of the fixed stars ; but the principal term of thischaracter does not vary with the time, and consequently is equivalent to apermanent constant displacement. The second-order terms (i.e. those whichinvolve the ordinary constant of aberration multiplied by the sun's velocity)might be measurable quantities in the case of stars near the Pole ; and the same is true of the variations in the first-order terms (i.e. those which involve the sun'svelocity not multiplied by the constant of aberration) due to the circumstancethat the star's apparent R. A. and Declination, which occur in these terms, arenot constant, but are affected by Precession, Nutation, and Aberration. Cf.Seeliger, Ast.

from Bradky to Fresnel. 101which his father, the elder John Bernoulli (b. 1667, d. 1748),had made in 1701 to connect the law of refraction with themechanical principle of the composition of forces. If twoopposed forces whose ratio is ju maintain in equilibrium aparticle which is free to move only in a given plane, it followsfrom the triangle of forces that the directions of the forces mustobey the relation
sin i = fj. sin r, where i and r denote the angles made by these directions withthe normals to the plane. This is the same equation as thatwhich expresses the law of refraction, and the elder Bernoulliconjectured that a theory of light might be based on it ; buthe gave no satisfactory physical reason for the existence of forces along the incident and refracted rays. This defect hisson now proceeded to remove.
All space, according to the younger Bernoulli, is permeatedby a fluid aether, containing an immense number of excessivelysmall whirlpools. The elasticity which the aether appears to
possess, and in virtue of which it is able to transmit vibrations,
is really due to the presence of these whirlpools ; for, owing to
-centrifugal force, each whirlpool is continually striving to
dilate, and so presses against the neighbouring whirlpools. Itwill be seen that Bernoulli is a thorough Cartesian in spirit ; not only does he reject action at a distance, but he insists thateven the elasticity of his aether shall be explicable in terms ofmatter and motion.
This aggregate of small vortices, or
" fine-grained turbulentmotion," as it came to be called a century and a half later,* is interspersed with solid corpuscles, whose dimensions are small-compared with their distances apart. These are pushed aboutby the whirlpools whenever the aether is disturbed, but nevertravel far from their original positions.
A source of light communicates to its surroundings adisturbance which condenses the nearest whirlpools ; these by* Cf. Lord Kelvin's vortex-sponge aether, described later in this work.
102 The Luminiferous Mediumi
their condensation displace the contiguous corpuscles from theirequilibrium position ; and these in turn produce condensationsin the whirlpools next beyond them, so that vibrations arepropagated in every direction from the luminous point. It iscurious that Bernoulli speaks of these vibrations as longitudinal,and actually contrasts them with those of a stretched cord,which,
" when it is slightly displaced from its rectilinear form,and then let go, performs transverse vibrations in a direction atright angles to the direction of the cord." When it isremembered that the objection to longitudinal vibrations, onthe score of polarization, had already been clearly stated byNewton, and that Bernoulli's aether closely resembles thatwhich Maxwell invented in 1861-2 for the express purposeofsecuring transversality of vibration, one feels that perhaps noman ever so narrowly missed a great discovery.
Bernoulli explained refraction by combining these ideaswith those of his father. Within the pores of ponderablebodies the whirlpools are compressed, so the centrifugal forcemust vary in intensity from one medium to another. Thusacorpuscle situated in the interface between two media is actedon by a greater elastic force from one medium than from theother; and by applying the triangle of forces to find the-conditions of its equilibrium, the law of Snell and Descartesr may be obtained.
Not long after this, the echoes of the old controversy' between Descartes and Fermat about the law of refractionwere awakened* by Pierre Louis Moreau deMaupertuis (b. 1698,,d. 1759).
It will be remembered that according to Descartes thevelocity of light is greatest in dense media, while according to-Fermat the propagation is swiftest in free aether. The arguments of the corpuscular theory convinced Maupertuis that onthis particular point Descartes was in the right ; but nevertheless he wished to retain for science the beautiful methodbywhich Fermat had derived his result. This he now proposed*Mem. de 1'Acad., 1744, p. 417.
from Bradley to Fresnel. 103to do by modifying Fermat's principle so as to make it agreewith the corpuscular theory; instead of assuming that light follows the quickest path, he supposed that " the path describedis that by which the quantity of action is the least
"
; and this action he defined to be proportional to the sum of the spacesdescribed, each multiplied by the velocity with which it is traversed. Thus instead of Fermat's expression
dt or
tds
} v (where t denotes time, v velocity, and ds an element of the path)Maupertuis introduced
/v ds
as the quantity which is to assume its minimum value when thepath of integration is the actual path of the light. SinceMaupertuis' v, which denotes the velocity according to thecorpuscular theory, is proportional to the reciprocal of Fermat'sv, which denotes the velocity according to the wave-theory, thetwo expressions are really equivalent, and lead to the same lawof refraction. Maupertuis' memoir is, however, of greatinterest from the point of view of dynamics ; for his suggestionwas subsequently developed by himself and by Euler andLagrange into a general principle which covers the wholerange of Nature, so far as Nature is a dynamical system.
The natural philosophers of the eighteenth century for themost part, like Maupertuis, accepted the corpuscular hypothesis ; 'but the wave-theory was not without defenders. Franklin*declared for it ; and the celebrated mathematician LeonhardEuler (b. 1707, d. 1783) ranged himself on the same side. In awork entitled Nova Theoria Lucis et Colorum, published! whilehe was living under the patronage of Frederic the Great atBerlin, he insisted strongly on the resemblance between lightand sound ; " light is in the aether the same thing as sound inair/' Accepting Newton's doctrine that colour depends on*

104 The Luminiferous Medium,
wave-length, he in this memoir supposed the frequency greatestfor red light, and least for violet ; but a few years later* headopted the opposite opinion.
The chief novelty of Euler's writings on light is hisexplanation of the manner in which material bodies appearcoloured when viewed by white light ; and, in particular, of theway in which the colours of thin plates are produced. Hedenied that such colours are due to a more copious reflexion oflight of certain particular periods, and supposed that theyrepresent vibrations generated within the body itself under thestimulus of the incident light. A coloured surface, accordingto this hypothesis, contains large numbers of elastic molecules,which, when agitated, emit light of period depending onlyon their own structure. The colours of thin plates Eulerexplained in the same way ; the elastic response and free periodof the plate at any place would, he conceived, depend onitsthickness at that place ; and in this way the dependence of thecolour on the thickness was accounted for, the phenomenaasa whole being analogous to well-known effects observed inexperiments on sound.
An attempt to improve the corpuscular theory in anotherdirection was made in 1752 by the Marquis de Courtivron,f andindependently in the following year by T. Melville Thesewriters suggested, as an explanation of the different refrangibility of different colours, that " the differently colour'd raysare projected with different velocities from the luminous body: the red with the greatest, violet with the least, and the inter-mediate colours with intermediate degrees of velocity." Onthis supposition, as its authors pointed out, the amountofaberration would be different for every different colour ; andthe satellites of Jupiter would change colour, from white throughgreen to violet, through an interval of more than half a minutebefore their immersion into the planet's shadow ; whileatemersion the contrary succession of colours should be observed,* Mem. del' Acad.de Berlin, 1752, p. 262. t Courtivron's Traite cfoptique, 1752.JPhil. Trans, xlviii (1753), p. 262.
from Bradley to FremeL 105
beginning with red and ending in white. The testimony of
practical astronomers was soon given that such appearances are not observed ; and the hypothesis was accordingly abandoned.
The fortunes of the wave-theory began to brighten at the
end of the century, when a new champion arose. ThomasYoung, born at Milverton in Somersetshire in 1773, and
trained to the practice of medicine, began to write on optical
theory in 1799. In his first paper* he remarked that, according'1 to the corpuscular theory, the velocity of emission of a
corpuscle must be the same in all cases, whether the projecting
force be that of the feeble spark produced by the friction of two Qpebbles, or the intense heat of the sun itself a thing almost
incredible. This difficulty does not exist in the undulatory
theory, since all disturbances are known to be transmitted^through an elastic fluid with the same velocity. The reluctance
which some philosophers felt to filling all space with an elastic
fluid he met with an argument which strangely foreshadows
the electric theory of light : " That a medium resembling in many properties that which has been denominated ether does
really exist, is undeniably proved by the phenomena of
electricity. The rapid transmission of the electrical shock
shows that the electric medium is possessed of an elasticity as great as is necessary to be supposed for the propagation of light.
Whether the electric ether is to be considered the same with
the luminous ether, if such a fluid exists, may perhaps at somefuture time be discovered by experiment : hitherto I have not
been able to observe that the refractive power of a fluid undergoes any change by electricity."
Young then proceeds to show the superior power of the^wave-theory to explain reflexion and refraction. In the
corpuscular theory it is difficult to see why part of the light
should be reflected and another part of the same beam reflected ; but in the undulatory theory there is no trouble, as is shownby analogy with the partial reflexion of sound from a cloud or _, denser stratum of air : " Nothing more is necessary than to
* Phil. Tni., 1800, p. 106.
106 The JLuminiferous Medium,
suppose all refracting media to retain, by their attraction,a,greater or less quantity of the luminous ether, so as to makeits-density greater than that which it possesses in a vacuum,without increasing its elasticity." This is precisely thehypothesis adopted later by Fresnel and Green.
In 1801 Young made a discovery of the first magnitude*when attempting to explain Newton's rings on the principlesofthe wave-theory. Eejecting Euler's hypothesis of inducedvibrations, he assumed that the colours observed all existinthe incident light, and showed that they could be derived fromit by a process which was now for the first time recognizedin optical science. The idea of this process was not altogether new, for it hadbeen used by Newton in his theory of the tides.
" It mayhappen," he wrote,f
" that the tide may be propagated fromtheocean through different channels towards the same port, andmay pass in less time through some channels than throughothers, in which case the same generating tide, being thusdivided into two or more succeeding one another, may produceby composition new types of tide." Newton applied this-principle to explain the anomalous tides at Batsha in Tonkin,which had previously been described by Halley.J
Young's own illustration of the principle is evidentlysuggested by Newton's. " Suppose," he says,
" a numberofequal waves of water to move upon the surface of a stagnantlake, with a certain constant velocity, and to enter a narrowchannel leading out of the lake ; suppose then another similarcause to have excited another equal series of waves, whicharrive at the same channel, with the same velocity, and atthesame time with the first. Neither series of waves will destroythe other, but their effects will be combined ; if they enterthechannel in such a manner that the elevations of one seriescoincide with those of the other, they must together produceaseries of greater joint elevations ; but if the elevations of one* Phil. Trans., 1802, pp. 12, 387. t Principia, Book in, Prop. 24. % Phil. Trans, xiv (1684), p. 681. Young's Works, i, p. 202.
from Bradley to Fremel. 107series are so situated as to correspond to the depressions of the
other, they must exactly fill up those depressions, and the
surface of the water must remain smooth. Now I maintain
that similar effects take place whenever two portions of light are thus mixed ; and this I call the general law of the interference of light."
Thus,
" whenever two portions of the same light arrive to the
eye by different routes, either exactly or very nearly in the samedirection, the light becomes most intense when the difference of the routes is any multiple of a certain length, and least intense
in the intermediate state of the interfering portions ; and this length is different for light of different colours." Young's explanation of the colours of thin plates as seen byreflexion was, then, that the incident light gives rise to two
beams which reach the eye : one of these beams has been
reflected at the first surface of the plate, and the other at the
second surface ; and these two beams produce the colours bytheir interference. One difficulty encountered in reconciling this theory with
observation arose from the fact that the central spot in Newton's
rings (where the thickness of the thin Him of air is zero) is black and not white, as it would be if the interfering beams were
similar to each other in all respects. To account for this Young' showed, by analogy with the impact of elastic bodies, that when-> light is reflected at the surface of a denser medium, its phase
is retarded by half an undulation : so that the interfering
beams at the centre of Newton's rings destroy each other. Thecorrectness of this assumption he verified by substituting essence
of sassafras (whose refractive index is intermediate between those
of crown and flint glass) for air in the space between the lenses ; as he anticipated, the centre of the ring-system was now white.
Newton had long before observed that the rings are smaller
~* when the medium producing them is optically more dense. Interpreted by Young's theory, this definitely proved that the
wave-length of light is shorter in dense media, and therefore
^ that its velocity is less.
108 The Lumini/erous Medium,
The publication of Young's papers occasioned a fierce attackon him in the Edinburgh Review, from the pen of HenryBrougham, afterwards Lord Chancellor of England. Youngreplied in a pamphlet, of which it is said* that only a singlecopy was sold ; and there can be no doubt that Broughamforthe time being achieved his object of discrediting the wavetheory, f
Young now turned his attention to the fringes of shadows.In the corpuscular explanation of these, it was supposedthatthe attractive forces which operate in refraction extend theirinfluence to some distance from the surfaces of bodies, andinflect such rays as pass close by. If this were the case,theamount of inflexion should obviously depend on the strengthofthe attractive forces, and consequently on the refractive indicesof the bodies a proposition which had been refuted bytheexperiments of s'Gravesande. The cause of diffraction effectswas thus wholly unknown, until Young, in the Bakerian lecturefor 1803,J showed that the principle of interference is concernedin their formation ; for when a hair is placed in the cone of raysdiverging from a luminous point, the internal fringes (i.e. thosewithin the geometrical shadow) disappear when the light passingon one side of the hair is intercepted. His conjecture as totheorigin of the interfering rays was not so fortunate ; for he attri-buted the fringes outside the geometrical shadow to interferencebetween the direct rays and rays reflected at the diffractingedge ; and supposed the internal fringes of the shadowofanarrow object to be due to the interference of rays inflectedbythe two edges of the object.
The success of so many developments of the wave-theoryled Young to inquire more closely into its capacity for solvingthe chief outstanding problem of optics that of the behaviourof light in crystals. The beautiful construction for the extra-* Peacock's Life of Young.

from Bradley( to FresneL 109ordinary ray given by Huygens had lain neglected for a century ; and the degree of accuracy with which it represented the
observations was unknown. At Young's suggestion Wollaston*
investigated the matter experimentally, and showed that the
agreement between his own measurements and Huygens' rule was remarkably close. " I think," he wrote,
" the result must be
admitted to be highly favourable to the Huygeniaii theory ; and, although the existence of two refractions at the same time,
in the same substance, be not well accounted for, and still less their interchange with each other, when a ray of light is madeto pass through a second piece of spar situated transversely to the first, yet the oblique refraction, when considered alone, seems
nearly as well explained as any other optical phenomenon."
Meanwhile the advocates of the corpuscular theory were not
idle ; and in the next few years a succession of discoveries on
their part, both theoretical and experimental, seemed likely to imperil the good position to which Young had advanced the
rival hypothesis.
The first of these was a dynamical explanation of the
refraction of the extraordinary ray in crystals, which was
published in 1808 by Laplace.f His method is an extension of that by which Maupertuis had accounted for the refraction of the ordinary ray, and which since Maupertuis' day had been so developed that it was now possible to apply it to problems of
all degrees of complexity. Laplace assumes that the crystalline
medium acts on the light-corpuscles of the extraordinary ray so as to modify their velocity, in a ratio which depends on the
inclination of the extraordinary ray to the axis of the crystal : so that, in fact, the difference of the squares of the velocities of the ordinary and extraordinary rays is proportional to the
square of the sine of the angle which the latter ray makes with
the axis. The principle of least action then leads to a law of refraction identical with that found by Huygens' construction

with the spheroid ; just as Maupertuis' investigation led toalaw of refraction for the ordinary ray identical with that foundby Huygens' construction with the sphere.
The law of refraction for the extraordinary ray may alsobededuced from Fermat's principle of least time, provided thatthevelocity is taken inversely proportional to that assumed in theprinciple of least action ; and the velocity appropriatetoFermat's principle agrees with that found by Huygens, being,iniact, proportional to the radius of the spheroid. These resultsare obvious extensions of those already obtained for ordinaryrefraction. Laplace's theory was promptly attacked by Young,* whopointed out the improbability of such a system of forcesaswould be required to impress the requisite change of velocityonthe light-corpuscles. If the aim of controversial matter is toconvince the contemporary world, Young's paper mustbecounted unsuccessful ; but it permanently enriched sciencebyproposing a dynamical foundation for double refraction ontheprinciples of the wave-theory.
" A solution," he says,
" mightbe deduced upon the Huygenian principles, from the simplestpossible supposition, that of a medium more easily compressiblein one direction than in any direction perpendicular to it, as ifitconsisted of an infinite number of parallel plates connectedbya substance somewhat less elastic. Such a structure of theelementary atoms of the crystal may be understood by comparing them to a block of wood or of mica. Mr. Chladni found thatthe mere obliquity of the fibres of a rod of Scotch fir reducedthe velocity with which it transmitted sound in the proportionof 4 to 5. It is therefore obvious that a block of such wood-must transmit every impulse in spheroidal that is, ovalundulations ; and it may also be demonstrated, as we shallshow at the conclusion of this article, that the spheroid willbetruly elliptical when the body consists either of plane andparallel strata, or of equidistant fibres, supposing both tobe^extremely thin, and to be connected by a less highly elastic* Quarterly Eeview, Nov., 1809 ; Young's Works, i, p. 220.
from Bradley to FremeL 111substance ; the spheroid being in the former case oblate and in the latter oblong." Young then proceeds to a formal proof
that "an impulse is propagated through every perpendicular
section of a lamellar elastic substance in the form of an elliptic
undulation." This must be regarded as the beginning of the dynamical theory of light in crystals. It was confirmed
in a striking way not long afterwards by Brewster,* who found
that compression in one direction causes an isotropic transparent
solid to become doubly-refracting.
Meanwhile, in January, 1808, the French Academy hadproposed as the subject for the physical prize in 1810,
" Tofurnish a mathematical theory of double refraction, and to confirm it by experiment." Among those who resolved to compete was Etienne Louis Malus (b. 1775, d. 1812), a colonel
of engineers who had seen service with Napoleon's expedition
to Egypt. While conducting experiments towards the end of 1808 in a house in the Kue des Enfers in Paris, Malus happenedto analyse with a rhomb of Iceland spar the light of the setting sun reflected from the window of the Luxembourg, and wassurprised to notice that the two images were of very different
intensities. Following up this observation, he found that light
which had been reflected from glass acquires thereby a modification similar to that which Huygens had noticed in rays
which have experienced double refraction, and which Newtonhad explained by supposing rays of light to have " sides." This
discovery appeared so important that without waiting for the
prize competition he communicated it to the Academy in December, 1808, and published it in the following month.f
" I have found," he said, " that this singular disposition,
which has hitherto been regarded as one of the peculiar effects of double refraction, can be completely impressed on the
luminous molecules by all transparent solids and liquids."
" For example, light reflected by the surface of water at an

112 The Luminiferous Medium,
angle of 5245' has all the characteristics of one of the beamsproduced by the double refraction of Iceland spar, whoseprincipal section is parallel to the plane which passes throughthe incident ray and the reflected ray. If we receive thisreflected ray on any doubly-refracting crystal, whose principalsection is parallel to the plane of reflexion, it will not be dividedinto two beams as a ray of ordinary light would be, but willberefracted according to the ordinary law."
After this Malus found that light which has been refractedat the surface of any transparent substance likewise possessesin some degree this property, to which he gave the namepolarization. The memoir* which he finally submitted to theAcademy, and which contains a rich store of experimentalandanalytical work on double refraction, obtained the prize in 1810;its immediate effect as regards the rival theories of the ultimatenature of light was to encourage the adherents of the corpusculardoctrine ; for it brought into greater prominence the phenomenaof polarization, of which the wave-theorists, still misled bytheanalogy of light with sound, were unable to give any account.The successful discoverer was elected to the AcademyofSciences, and became a member of the celebrated club of Arcueil.fBut his health, which had been undermined by the Egyptiancampaign, now broke down completely : and he died, at theageof thirty-six, in the following year. The polarization of a reflected ray is in general incompletei.e. the ray displays only imperfectly the properties of lightwhich has been polarized by double refraction ; but for oneparticular angle of incidence, which depends on the reflectingbody, the polarization of the reflected ray is complete. Malusmeasured with considerable accuracy the polarizing angles forglass and water, and attempted to connect them with the otheroptical constants of these substances, the refractive indices anddispersive powers, but without success. The matter was* Mem. presentes a 1'Inst. par divers Savans, ii (1811), p. 303. t So called from the village near Paris where Laplace and Berthollet hadtheir country-houses, and where the meetings took place. The club consistedofa dozen of the most celebrated scientific men in France.
from Bradley to Fresnel. 113afterwards taken up by David Brewster (b. 1781, d. 1868), whoin 1815* showed that there is complete polarization by reflexion when the reflected and refracted rays satisfy the condition of being at right angles to each other. Almost at the same time Brewster made another discovery
which profoundly affected the theory of double refraction. It had till then been believed that double refraction is always
of the type occurring in Iceland spar, to which Huygens'construction is applicable. Brewster now found this belief to beerroneous, and showed that in a large class of crystals there are two axes, instead of one, along which there is no double
refraction. Such crystals are called Uaxal, the simpler type to which Iceland spar belongs being called uniaxal.
The wave-theory at this time was still encumbered with
difficulties. Diffraction was not satisfactorily explained ; for polarization no explanation of any kind was forthcoming ; the
Huygenian construction appeared to require two different luminiferous media within doubly refracting bodies ; and the
universality of that construction had been impugned byBrewster's discovery of biaxal crystals.
The upholders of the emission theory, emboldened by the
success of Laplace's theory of double refraction, thought the
time ripe for their final triumph ; and as a step to this, in March, 1817, they proposed Diffraction as the subject of the
Academy's prize for 1818. Their expectation was disappointed ; and the successful memoir afforded the first of a series of reverses by which, in the short space of seven years, the
corpuscular theory was completely overthrown.
The author was Augustin Fresnel (b. 1788, d. 1827), the son of an architect, and himself a civil engineer in the
Government service in Normandy. During the brief dominanceof Napoleon after his escape from Elba in 1815, Fresnel fell into trouble for having enlisted in the small army which attempted
to bar the exile's return ; and it was during a period of enforced
idleness following on his arrest that he commenced to study

114 The Lumini/erous Medium,
diffraction. In his earliest memoir* he propounded a theorysimilar to that of Young, which was spoiled like Young'stheory by the assumption that the fringes depend on lightreflected by the diffracting edge. Observing, however, that theblunt and sharp edges of a knife produce exactly the samefringes, he became dissatisfied with this attempt, and on July15th, 1816, presented to the Academy a supplement to hispaper,f in which, for the first time, diffraction-effects arereferred to their true cause namely, the mutual interferenceof the secondary waves emitted by those portions of the originalwave-front which have not been obstructed by the diffractingscreen. Fresnel's method of calculation utilized the principlesof both Huygens and Young ; he summed the effects duetodifferent portions of the same primary wave-front, with dueregard to the differences of phase engendered in propagation.
The sketch presented to the Academy in 1816 was duringthe next two years developed into an exhaustive memoir,Jwhich was submitted for the Academy's prize. It so happened that the earliest memoir, which had beenpresented to the Academy in the autumn of 1815, had beenreferred to a Commission of which the reporter was FrancoisArago (&. 1786, d. 1853) ; Arago was so much impressed thathe sought the friendship of the author, of whom he was laterastrenuous champion.
A champion was indeed needed when the larger memoir wassubmitted ; for Laplace, Poisson, and Biot, who constitutedamajority of the Commission to which it was referred, were allzealous supporters of the corpuscular theory. During theexamination, however, Fresnel was vindicated in a somewhatcurious way. He had calculated in the memoir the diffraction-patterns of a straight edge, of a narrow opaque body boundedby parallel sides, and of a narrow opening bounded by paralleledges, and had shown that the results agreed excellently with* Annales de Chimie (2), i (1816), p 239 ; (Euvres, i, p. 89. t (Euvres, i, p. 129.

his experimental measures. Poisson, when reading the manuscript, happened to notice that the analysis could be extended
to other cases, and in particular that it would indicate the
existence of a bright spot at the centre of the shadow of a
circular screen. He suggested to Fresnel that this and some
further consequences should be tested experimentally ; this was
done, and the results were found to confirm the new theory.
The concordance of observation and calculation was so admirable
in all cases where a comparison was possible that the prize was
awarded to Fresnel without further hesitation. In the same year in which the memoir on diffraction was
submitted, Fresnel published an investigation* of the influence
of the earth's motion on light. We have already seen that
aberration was explained by its discoverer in terms of the
corpuscular theory ; and it was Young who first showedf howit may be explained on the wave-hypothesis.
" Upon considering the phenomena of the aberration of the stars," he
wrote,
" I am disposed to believe that the luminiferous aether
pervades the substance of all material bodies with little or no
resistance, as freely perhaps as the wind passes through a grove of trees." In fact, if we suppose the aether surrounding
the earth to be at rest and unaffected by the earth's motion,
the light-waves will not partake of the motion of the telescope , which we may suppose directed to the true place of the star, and the image of the star will therefore be displaced from the
central spider-line at the focus by a distance equal to that
which the earth describes while the light is travelling through
the telescope. This agrees with what is actually observed.
But a host of further questions now suggest themselves.
Suppose, for instance, that a slab of glass with a plane face is carried along by the motion of the earth, and it is desired to adjust it so that a ray of light coming from a certain star
shall not be bent when it enters the glass : must the
.surface be placed at right angles to the true direction of the

116 The Luminiferous Medium,
star as freed from aberration, or to its apparent direction asaffected by aberration ? The question whether rays comingfrom the stars are refracted differently from rays originating in terrestrial sources had been raised originally byMichell* ; and Kobison and Wilsonf had asserted that the focallength of an achromatic telescope should be increased whenitis directed to a star towards which the earth is moving, owingto the change in the relative velocity of light. AragoJ submitted the matter to the test of experiment, and concluded thatthe light coming from any star behaves in all cases of reflexionand refraction precisely as it would if the star were situated inthe place which it appears to occupy in consequence of aberration, and the earth were at rest ; so that the apparentrefraction in a moving prism is equal to the absolute refractionin a fixed prism.
Fresnel now set out to provide a theory capable of explainingArago's result. To this end he adopted Young's suggestion,that the refractive powers of transparent bodies depend on theconcentration of aether within them ; and made it more preciseby assuming that the aethereal density in any body is pro-portional to the square of the refractive index. Thus, if cdenote the velocity of light in vacuo, and if c, denote itsvelocity in a given material body at rest, so that /u = c/o{ is therefractive index, then the densities p and pl of the aether ininterplanetary space and in the body respectively will beconnected by the relation
pi = n*P- Fresnel further assumed that, when a body is in motion, partof the aether within it is carried along namely, that part whichconstitutes tne excess of its density over the density of aetherin vacuo ; while the rest of the aether within the space occupiedby the body is stationary. Thus the density of aether carried* Phil. Trans., 1784, p. 35. t Trans. E. S. Edin., i, Hist., p. 30. J Biot, Astron. Phys., 3rd ed., v, p. 364.

remains at rest. The velocity with which the centreof gravity of the aether within the body moves forward in thedirection of propagation is therefore
where w denotes the component of the velocity of the body in
this direction. This is to be added to the velocity of propagation of the light-waves within the body ; so that in the movingbody the absolute velocity of light is
Many years afterwards Stokes* put the same supposition ina slightly different form. Suppose the whole of the aetherwithin the body to move together, the aether entering the bodyin front, and being immediately condensed, and issuing from it behind, where it is immediately rarefied. On this assumption amass pw of aether must pass in unit time across a plane of areaunity, drawn anywhere within the body in a direction at rightangles to the body's motion; and therefore the aether withinthe body has a drift-velocity -
wp/pl relative to the body : sothe velocity of light relative to the body will be Ci -

or ci + ^i w, as before. P
This formula was experimentally confirmed in 1851 byH. Fizeau,f who measured the displacement of interferencefringes formed by light which had passed through a column ofmoving water.

118 The Luminiferous Medium,
The same result may easily be deduced from an experimentperformed by Hoek.* In this a beam of light was divided intotwo portions, one of which was made to passthrough a tube of water AB and was then reflectedat a mirror C, the light being afterwards allowedtoreturn to A without passing through the water: while the other portion of the bifurcated beamwasmade to describe the same path in the reverseorder, i.e. passing through the water on its return,. journey from C instead of on the outward journey,On causing the two portions of the beam to interfere, Hoek found that no difference of phase was producedbetween them when the apparatus was oriented in the directionof the terrestrial motion.
Let w denote the velocity of the earth, supposed to bedirected from the tube towards the mirror. Let c/n denote thevelocity of light in the water at rest, and C/A* + <l> the velocityof light in the water when moving. Let I denote the lengthofthe tube.

Suppose that aprism AQ (7 B is carried along by the earth's motion in vacuo, its face A(, C being at right angles to the direction of motion ; andthat light from a star is incident normally on this face.

Suppose that during an interval T of time the prism travels fromthe position AQ C Bo to the position A Ci B^ while the luminousdisturbance at C travels to h and the luminous disturbance atA travels to D, so that Bv D is the emergent wave-front.

Butthis correction is w sin 8/c, and precisely counteracts the effectwhich has been calculated as due to the motion of the prism.So finally we see that the motion of the earth has no first-orderinfluence on the refraction of light from the stars. Fresnel inferred from his formula that if observations weremade with a telescope filled with water, the aberration wouldbeunaffected by the presence of the water a result whichwasverified by Airy* in 1871. He showed, moreover, that theapparent positions of terrestrial objects, carried along withtheobserver, are not displaced by the earth's motion ; that experiments in refraction and interference are not influenced byanymotion which is common to the source, apparatus, and observer;and that light travels between given points of a moving materialsystem by the path of least time. These predictions have also beenconfirmed by observation: Kespighif in 1861, and Hoek+ in 1868,experimenting with a telescope filled with water and a terrestrialsource of light, found that no effect was produced onthephenomena of reflexion and refraction by altering the orienta-* Proc.

Mascart* in 1872 discussed experimentally thequestion of the effect of motion of the source or recipient oflight in all its bearings, and showed that the light of the sun andthat derived from artificial sources are alike incapable of revealingby diffraction-phenomena the translatory motion of the earth. The greatest problem now confronting the investigators oflight was to reconcile the facts of polarization with the principlesof the wave-theory. Young had long been pondering over this,
but had hitherto been baffled by it. In 1816 he received avisit from Arago, who told him of a new experimental resultwhich he and Fresnel had lately obtained! namely, that twopencils of light, polarized in planes at right angles, do notinterfere with each other under circumstances in which ordinarylight shows interference-phenomena, but always give by theirreunion the same intensity of light, whatever be their differenceof path.
Arago had not long left him when Young, reflecting on thenew experiment, discovered the long-sought key to the mystery: it consisted in the very alternative which Bernoulli had rejectedeighty years before, of supposing that the vibrations of light areexecuted at right angles to the direction of propagation.
Young's ideas were first embodied in a letter to Arago,Jdated Jan. 12, 1817. "I have been reflecting," he wrote,
" on thepossibility of giving an imperfect explanation of the affectionof light which constitutes polarization, without departing fromthe genuine doctrine of undulations. It is a principle in thistheory, that all undulations are simply propagated throughhomogeneous mediums in concentric spherical surfaces like theAnn. de 1'Ecole Noemale, (2) i, p. 157. t It was not published until 1819, in Annales de Chimie, x ; Fresnel's (Euvres,
i, p. 509. By means of this result, Fresnel was able to give a complete explanation of a class of phenomena which Arago had discovered in 1811, viz. that whenpolarized light is transmitted through thin plates of sulphate of lime or mica, andafterwards analysed by a prism of Iceland spar, beautiful complementary colours
are displayed. Young had shown that these effects are due essentially to inter- ference, hut had not made clear the part played by polarization. J Young's JTorks, i., p. 380.

undulations of sound, consisting simply in the direct and retro-grade motions of the particles in the direction of the radius,,with their concomitant condensation and rarefactions. Andyet it is possible to explain in this theory a transverse vibration,,propagated also in the direction of the radius, and with equalvelocity, the motions of the particles being in a certain constantdirection with respect to that radius ; and this is a polarization"In an article on
" Chromatics," which was writteninSeptember of the same year* for the supplement to theEncyclopaedia Britannica, he says :f " If we assume as a mathematical postulate, on the undulating theory, without attemptingto demonstrate its physical foundation, that a transverse motionmay be propagated in a direct line, we may derive fromthisassumption a tolerable illustration of the subdivision of polarizedlight by reflexion in an oblique plane," by
" supposing the polarmotion to be resolved
" into two constituents, which faredifferently at reflexion. In a further letter to Arago, dated April 29th, 1818, Youngrecurred to the subject of transverse vibrations, comparing lightto the undulations of a cord agitated by one of its extremities.^This letter was shown by Arago to Fresnel, who at once sawthat it presented the true explanation of the non-interferenceof beams polarized in perpendicular planes, and that the lattereffect could even be made the basis of a proof of the correctnessof Young's hypothesis : for if the vibration of each beambesupposed resolved into three components, one along the rayandthe other two at right angles to it, it is obvious from the AragoFresnel experiment that the components in the direction of theray must vanish : in other words, that the vibrations whichconstitute light are executed in the wave-front.
It must be remembered that the theory of the propagationof waves in an elastic solid was as yet unknown, and light was* Peacock's Life of Young, p. 391. t Young's Works, i., p. 279.JThis analogy had been given by Hooke in a communication to the RoyalSociety on Feb. 15, 1671-2. But there seems no reason to suppose that Hooke-appreciated the point now advanced by Young.
from Bradley to FresneL 123still always interpreted by the analogy with the vibrations of sound in air, for which the direction of vibration is the same as that of propagation. It was therefore necessary to give somejustification for the new departure. With wonderful insight
Fresnel indicated* the precise direction in which the theory of vibrations in ponderable bodies needed to be extended in order
to allow of waves similar to those of light : " the geometers," hewrote,
" who have discussed the vibrations of elastic fluids hitherto
have taken account of no accelerating forces except those arising
from the difference of condensation or dilatation between conse- cutive layers." He pointed out that if we also suppose the
medium to possess a rigidity, or power of resisting distortion, suchas is manifested by all actual solid bodies, it will be capable of transverse vibration. The absence of longitudinal waves in the
aether he accounted for by supposing that the forces which oppose
condensation are far more powerful than those which oppose
distortion, and that the velocity with which condensations are propagated is so great compared with the speed of the oscillations
of light, that a practical equilibrium of pressure is maintainedperpetually.
The nature of ordinary non-polarized light was next discussed.
"
If then," Fresnel wrote,f
" the polarization of a ray of light
consists in this, that all its vibrations are executed in the samedirection, it results from any hypothesis on the generation of light-waves, that a ray emanating from a single centre of dis- turbance will always be polarized in a definite plane at anyinstant. But an instant afterwards, the direction of the motionchanges, and with it the plane of polarization ; and these
variations follow each other as quickly as the perturbations of the vibrations of the luminous particle : so that even if we could
*Annales de Chiinie, xvii (1821), p. 180; (Eiwres, i, p. 629. Young had
already drawn attention to this point. " It is difficult," he says in his Lectures on Natural Philosophy, ed. 1807, vol. i, p. 138, "to compare the lateral adhesion, or the force which resists the detrusion of the parts of a solid, with any form of direct cohesion. This force constitutes the rigidity or hardness of a solid body, and is wholly absent from liquids." t Loc. cit, p. 185.
124 The Luminiferous Medium,
isolate the light of this particular particle from that of otherluminous particles, we should doubtless not recognize in it anyappearance of polarization. If we consider now the effect pro-duced by the union of all the waves which emanate fromthedifferent points of a luminous body, we see that at each instant,at a definite point of the aether, the general resultant of all themotions which commingle there will have a determinatedirection, but this direction will vary from one instant tothenext. So direct light can be considered as the union, or moreexactly as the rapid succession, of systems of waves polarizedinall directions. According to this way of looking at the matter,the act of polarization consists not in creating these transversemotions, but in decomposing them in two invariable directions,and separating the components from each other ; for . then,ineach of them, the oscillatory motions take place always inthesame plane."
He then proceeded to consider the relation of the directionofvibration to the plane of polarization.
" Apply these ideastodouble refraction, and regard a uniaxal crystal as an elasticmedium in which the accelerating force which results fromthe displacement of a row of molecules perpendicular totheaxis, relative to contiguous rows, is the same all roundtheaxis ; while the displacements parallel to the axis produceaccelerating forces of a different intensity, stronger if thecrystal is "repulsive," and weaker if it is "attractive." Thedistinctive character of the rays which are ordinarily refractedbeing that of propagating themselves with the same velocityin all directions, we must admit that their oscillatory motionsare executed at right angles to the plane drawn throughtheserays and the axis of the crystal; for then the displacementswhich they occasion, always taking place along directionsperpendicular to the axis, will, by hypothesis, always giveriseto the same accelerating forces. But, with the conventionalmeaning which is attached to the expression 'plane, ofpolarization,the plane of polarization of the ordinary rays is the planethrough the axis : thus, in a pencil of polarized light, the
from Bradley, to Fresnel. 125
oscillatory motion is executed at right angles to the plane of
polarization"
This result afforded Fresnel a foothold in dealing with the
problem which occupied the rest of his life : henceforth his aim was to base the theory of light on the dynamical properties of the luminiferous medium.
The first topic which he attacked from this point of view was the propagation of light in crystalline bodies. Since
Brewster's discovery that many crystals do not conform to the
type to which Huygens' construction is applicable, the wave
theory had to some extent lost credit in this region. Fresnel,
now, by what was perhaps the most brilliant of all his efforts,*
not only reconquered the lost territory, but added a new domain
to science. He had, as he tells us himself, never believed the doctrine
that in crystals there are two different luminiferous media, one to transmit the ordinary, and the other the extraordinary
waves. The alternative to which he inclined was that the twovelocities of propagation were really the two roots of a quadratic
equation, derivable in some way from the theory of a single
aether. Could this equation be obtained, he was confident of finding the explanation, not only of double refraction, but also
of the polarization by which it is always accompanied.
The first step was to take the case of uniaxal crystals,
which had been discussed by Huygens, and to see whether
Huygens' sphere and spheroid could be replaced by, or made to depend on, a single surface.f Now a wave propagated in any direction through a uniaxal

finally collected in a memoir which was printed in 1827, Mem. de VAcad. vii, p. 45, (Euvres, ii, p. 479. t In attempting to reconstruct Fresnel's course of thought at this period, the

crystal can be resolved into two plane-polarized components;one of these, the " ordinary ray," is polarized in the principalsection, and has a velocity vl9 which may be represented bytheradius of Huygens' sphere say,
Vi = &; while the other, the " extraordinary ray," is polarized in a plane.at right angles to the principal section, and has a wave-velocityv9,which may be represented by the perpendicular drawn fromthecentre of Huygens' spheroid on the tangent-plane parallel to theplane of the wave. If the spheroid be represented bytheequation

plane-polarized waves whose normals are in the direction
(I, m, n). Having thus arrived at his result by reasoning of a purely
geometrical character, he now devised a dynamical scheme to
suit it. The vibrating medium within a crystal he supposed to be
ultimately constituted of particles subjected to mutual forces ; and on this assumption he showed that the elastic force of restitution when the system is disturbed must depend linearly on the displacement. In this first proposition a difference is apparent between Fresnel's and a true elastic-solid theory ; for in actual elastic solids the forces of restitution depend not on
the absolute displacement, but on the strains, i.e., the relative displacements.
In any crystal there will exist three directions at right
angles to each other, for which the force of restitution acts in the same line as the displacement : the directions which possess
this property are named axes of elasticity. Let these be taken
as axes, and suppose that the elastic forces of restitution for unit displacements in these three directions are 1/5], l/c2, l/s
respectively. That the elasticity should vary with the direction
of the molecular displacement seemed to Fresnel to suggest that
the molecules of the material body either take part in the
luminous vibration, or at any rate influence in some way the
elasticity of the aether. A unit displacement in any arbitrary* direction (a, )3, 7) can
be resolved into component displacements (cos a, cos /3, cos 7)
parallel to the axes, and each of these produces its own effect

i 2 3 will therefore have the property that the square of its radiusvector in any direction is proportional to the component in thatdirection of the elastic force due to a unit displacement in thatdirection : it is called the surface of elasticity.
Consider now a displacement along one of the axes of thesection on which the surface of elasticity is intersected bytheplane of the wave. It is easily seen that in this case the component of the elastic force at right angles to the displacementacts along the normal to the wave-front; and Fresnel assumesthat it will be without influence on the propagation of thevibrations, on the ground of his fundamental hypothesis thatthevibrations of light are performed solely in the wave-front. Thisstep is evidently open to criticism ; for in a dynamical theoryeverything should be deduced from the laws of motion withoutspecial assumptions. But granting his contention, it followsthat such a displacement will retain its direction, and willbepropagated as a plane-polarized wave with a definite velocity.Now, in order that a stretched cord may vibrate withunchanged period, when its tension is varied, its length mustbeincreased proportionally to the square root of its tension ; andsimilarly the wave-length of a luminous vibration of given periodis proportional to the square root of the elastic force (per unit
from Bradley to Fresnel. 129displacement), which urges the molecules of the medium parallel to the wave-front. Hence the velocity of propagation of awave, measured at right angles to its front, is proportional to the square root of the component, along the direction of dis- placement, of the elastic force per unit displacement ; and thevelocity of propagation of such a plane-polarized wave as wehave considered is proportional to the radius vector of thesurface of elasticity in the direction of displacement.
Moreover, any displacement in the given wave-front can beresolved into two, which are respectively parallel to the twoaxes of the diametral section of the surface of elasticity by aplane parallel to this wave-front ; and it follows from what hasbeen said that each of these component displacements will bepropagated as an independent plane-polarized wave, the velocities
of propagation being proportional to the axes of the section,*
and therefore inversely proportional to the axes of the section ofthe inverse surface of this with respect to the origin, which is the ellipsoid *

i 2 3 But this is precisely the result to which, as we have seen,Fresnel had been led by purely geometrical considerations ; andthus his geometrical conjecture could now be regarded assubstantiated by a study of the dynamics of the medium.
It is easy to determine the wave-surface or locus at anyinstant say, t = 1 of a disturbance originated at some previousinstant say, = at some particular point say, the origin. Forthis wave-surface will evidently be the envelope of plane wavesemitted from the origin at the instant t = that is, it will bethe envelope of planes

As Fresnelobserved, exactly the same construction applies to biaxalcrystals, when the two sheets of the wave-surface are substi-tuted for Huygens' sphere and spheroid.
" The theory which I have adopted," says Fresnel at theendof this memorable paper,
" and the simple constructions whichI have deduced from it, have this remarkable character, thatall the unknown quantities are determined together bythesolution of the problem. We find at the same timethevelocities of the ordinary ray and of the extraordinary ray, andtheir planes of polarization. Physicists who have studiedattentively the laws of nature will feel that such simplicity and* Another construction for the wave-surface is the following, which is duetoMacCullagh, Coll. Works, p. 1.

from Bradley to FresneL 131such close relations between the different elements of the
phenomenon are conclusive in favour of the hypothesis onwhich they are based." The question as to the correctness of Fresnel's construction was discussed for many years afterwards. A striking conse- quence of it was pointed out in 1832 by William KowanHamilton (b. 1805, d. 1865), Royal Astronomer of Ireland, whoremarked* that the surface defined by Fresnel's equation has
four conical points, at each of which there is an infinite numberof tangent planes ; consequently, a single ray, proceeding froma point within the crystal in the direction of one of these
points, must be divided on emergence into an infinite number of
rays, constituting a conical surface. Hamilton also showedthat there are four planes, each of which touches the wavesurface in an infinite number of points, constituting a circle of contact : so that a corresponding ray incident externally shouldbe divided within the crystal into an infinite number of refracted
rays, again constituting a conical surface. These singular and unexpected consequences of the theorywere shortly afterwards verified experimentally by HumphreyLloyd,f and helped greatly to confirm belief in Fresnel's theory.
It should, however, be observed that conical refraction only
shows his form of the wave- surface to be correct in its general
features, and is no test of its accuracy in all details. But it was shown experimentally by Stokes in 1872J Glazebrook in 1879, and Hastings in 1887,1 1 that the construction of Huygensand Fresnel is certainly correct to a very high degree of approximation; and Fresnel's final formulae have since beenregarded as unassailable. The dynamical substructure onwhich he based them is, as we have seen, open to objection ; * Trans. Roy. Irish Acad., xvii (1833), p. 1. t Trans. Roy. Irish Acad., xvii (1833), p. 145. Strictly speaking, the bright oone which is usually observed arises from rays adjacent to the singular ray : the latter can, however, be observed, its enfeeblement by dispersion into the
conical form causing it to appear dark.

but, as Stokes observed*: "If we reflect on the state ofthesubject as Fresnel found it, and as he left it, the wonder is, notthat he failed to give a rigorous dynamical theory, but thatasingle mind was capable of effecting so much."
In a second supplement to his first memoir on DoubleEefraction, presented to the Academy on November 26th, 1821,-]-Fresnel indicated the lines on which his theory mightbeextended so as to take account of dispersion.
" The moleculargroups, or the particles of bodies," he wrote,
" may be separatedby intervals which, though small, are certainly not altogetherinsensible relatively to the length of a wave." Such a coarse-grainedness of the medium would, as he foresaw, introduceintothe equations terms by which dispersion might be explained;indeed, the theory of dispersion which was afterwards givenbyCauchy was actually based on this principle. It seems likelythat, towards the close of his life, Fresnel was contemplatingagreat memoir on dispersion^ which was never completed.
Fresnel had reason at first to be pleased with the receptionofhis work on the optics of crystals : for in August, 1822, Laplacespoke highly of it in public ; and when at the end of the yearaseat in the Academy became vacant, he was encouraged to hopethat the choice would fall on him. In this he was disappointed.. Meanwhile his researches were steadily continued ; andinJanuary, 1823, the very month of his rejection, he presentedto-the Academy a theory in which reflexion and refraction] | arereferred to the dynamical properties of the luminiferous media.*Brit.

from Bradley to FresneL 133As in his previous investigations, he assumes that the
vibrations which constitute light are executed at right angles
to the plane of polarization. He adopts Young's principle, that
reflexion and refraction are due to differences in the inertia of the aether in different material bodies, and supposes (as in
his memoir on Aberration) that the inertia is proportional to the inverse square of the velocity of propagation of light in
the medium. The conditions which he proposes to satisfy at the
interface between two media are that the displacements of the
adjacent molecules, resolved parallel to this interface, shall be
equal in the two media ; and that the energy of the reflected and refracted waves together shall be equal to that of the
incident wave. On these assumptions the intensity of the reflected and
refracted light may be obtained in the following way : Consider first the case in which the incident light is polarized in the plane of incidence, so that the displacement is at right angles to the plane of incidence ; let the amplitude
of the displacement at a given point of the interface be /for the incident ray, g for the reflected ray, and h for the
refracted ray. The quantities of energy propagated per second across unit
cross-section of the incident, reflected, and refracted beams are proportional respectively to
where cb c2, denote the velocities of light, and pl} pz the densities of aether, in the two media ; and the cross-sections of the beams
which meet the interface in unit area are
cos i, cos i, cos r
respectively. The principle of conservation of energy therefore gives
c,p! cos i ./ 2 =
c,/o! cos i . g

Fresnel shows in a similar way that when the lightispolarized at right angles to the plane of reflexion, the ratioofthe amplitudes of the reflected and incident waves is tan (i -

These formulae are generally known as Fresnel's sine-law andFresneTs tangent-law respectively. They had, however, beendiscovered experimentally by Brewster some years previously.When the incidence is perpendicular, so that i and r are verysmall, the ratio of the amplitudes becomes

frovi Bradley to Fresnel. 135perpendicular to each other, the reflected light will be whollypolarized in the plane of reflexion. Fre&nel's investigation can scarcely be called a dynamicaltheory in the strict sense, as the qualities of the medium are not defined. His method was to work backwards from theknown properties of light, in the hope of arriving at a mechanismto which they could be attributed ; he succeeded in accountingfor the phenomena in terms of a few simple principles, but wasnot able to specify an aether which would in turn account for these principles. The " displacement
" of Fresnel could not bea displacement in an elastic solid of the usual type, since its normal component is not continuous across the interface betweentwo media.*
The theory of ordinary reflexion was completed by a dis- cussion of the case in which light is reflected totally. This hadformed the subject of some of Fresnel's experimental researchesseveral years before; and in two papersf presented to theAcademy in November, 1817, and January, 1818, he had shownthat light polarized in any plane inclined to the plane of reflexion
is partly "depolarized" by total reflexion, and that this is due to differences of phase which are introduced between thecomponents polarized in and perpendicular to the plane of
reflexion. " When the reflexion is total," he said,
" rayspolarized in the plane of reflexion are reflected nearer thesurface of the glass than those polarized at right angles to thesame plane, so that there is a difference in the paths described."This change of phase he now deduced from the formulaealready obtained for ordinary reflexion. Considering light
polarized in the plane of reflexion, the ratio of the amplitudes ofthe reflected and incident light is, as we have seen, sin (i -
r) sin (i + r)
' when the sine of the angle of incidence is greater than /i2/jui, * Fresnel's theory of reflexion can, however, he reconciled with the electro- magnetic theory of light, by identifying his "displacement" with the electric force. f (Euvres de Fresnel, i., pp. 441, 487.

so that total reflexion takes place, this ratio may be written inthe form
where 6 denotes a real quantity defined by the equation

cos ^ Fresnel interpreted this expression to mean that theamplitude of the reflected light is equal to that of the incident,but that the two waves differ in phase by an amount 0. Thecase of light polarized at right angles to the plane of reflexionmay be treated in the same way, and the resulting formulae arecompletely confirmed by experiment.
A few months after the memoir on reflexion had beenpresented, Fresnel was elected to a seat in the Academy ; andduring the rest of his short life honours came to him both fromFrance and abroad. In 1827 the Royal Society awarded himthe Rumford medal ; but Arago, to whom Young had confidedthe mission of conveying the medal, found him dying ; andeight days afterwards he breathed his last. By the genius of Young and Fresnel the wave-theoryoflight was established in a position which has since remainedunquestioned ; and it seemed almost a work of supererogationwhen, in 1850, Foucault* and Fizeau,f carrying out a plan longbefore imagined by Arago, directly measured the velocity oflight in air and in water, and found that on the question solong debated between the rival schools the adherents of theundulatory theory had been in the right.

CHAPTER V.
THE AETHER AS AN ELASTIC SOLID. WHEN Young and Fresnel put forward the view that the
vibrations of light are performed at right angles to its direction
of propagation, they at the same time pointed out that this peculiarity might be explained by making a new hypothesis
regarding the nature of the luminiferous medium ; namely, that
it possesses the power of resisting attempts to distort its shape.
It is by the possession of such a power that solid bodies are distinguished from fluids, which offer no resistance to distortion;
the idea of Young and Fresnel may therefore be expressed by
the simple statement that the aether behaves as an elastic solid. After the death of Fresnel this conception was developed in a
brilliant series of memoirs to which our attention must now be
directed. The elastic-solid theory meets with one obvious difficulty at the outset. If the aether has the qualities of a solid, how is it that
the planets in their orbital motions are able to journey through
it at immense speeds without encountering any perceptible
resistance ? This objection was first satisfactorily answered by
Sir George Gabriel Stokes* (b. 1819, d. 1903), who remarked
that such substances as pitch and shoemaker's wax, though so
rigid as to be capable of elastic vibration, are yet sufficiently
plastic to permit other bodies to pass slowly through them.
The aether, he suggested, may have this combination of qualities in an extreme degree, behaving like an elastic solid for vibrations
so rapid as those of light, but yielding like a fluid to the muchslower progressive motions of the planets. Stokes's explanation harmonizes in a curious way with
Fresnel's hypothesis that the velocity of longitudinal waves in

138 The Aether as an Elastic Solid.
the aether is indefinitely great compared with that of thetransverse waves ; for it is found by experiment with actualsubstances that the ratio of the velocity of propagationoflongitudinal waves to that of transverse waves increasesrapidly as the medium becomes softer and more plastic.
In attempting to set forth a parallel between light andthevibrations of an elastic substance, the investigator is compelledmore than once to make a choice between alternatives. Hemay, for instance, suppose that the vibrations of the aetherareexecuted either parallel to the plane of polarization of the lightor at right angles to it ; and he may suppose that the differentrefractive powers of different media are due either to differencesin the inertia of the aether within the media, or to differencesin its power of resisting distortion, or to both these causescombined. There are, moreover, several distinct methodsforavoiding the difficulties caused by the presence of longitudinalvibrations ; and as, alas ! we shall see, a further sourceofdiversity is to be found in that liability to error from whichnoman is free. It is therefore not surprising that the list ofelastic-solid theories is a long one. At the time when the transversality of light was dis-covered, no general method had been developed for investi-gating mathematically the properties of elastic bodies; butunder the stimulus of Fresnel's discoveries, some of the bestintellects of the age were attracted to the subject. The volumeof Memoirs of the Academy which contains Fresnel's theoryofcrystal-optics contains also a memoir by Claud Louis MarieHenri Navier* (&. 1785, d. 1836), at that time ProfessorofMechanics in Paris, in which the correct equations of vibratorymotion for a particular type of elastic solid were for the firsttime given. ISTavier supposed the medium to be ultimatelyconstituted of an immense number of particles, which actoneach other with forces directed along the lines joining them,anddepending on their distances apart ; and showed that if e denote* Mem. de 1'Acad. vii, p. 375. The memoir was presented in 1821, andpublished in 1827.

p = - 3n grad div e - n curl curl e, ot where n denotes a constant which measures the rigidity, orpower of resisting distortion, of the medium. All such elastic properties of the body as the velocity of propagation of wavesin it must evidently depend on the ratio n/p.
Among the referees of one of Navier's papers was AugustineLouis Cauchy (b. 1789, d. 1857), one of the greatest analysts of the nineteenth century,* who, becoming interested in thequestion, published in 1828f a discussion of it from an entirelydifferent point of view. Instead of assuming, as Navier haddone, that the medium is an aggregate of point-centres of force,
and thus involving himself in doubtful molecular hypotheses,he devised a method of directly studying the elastic propertiesof matter in bulk, and by its means showed that the vibrationsof an isotropic solid are determined by the equation

Cauchy's equation evidently differs from Navier's in that* Hamilton's opinion, written in 1833, is worth repeating : " The principal
theories of algebraical analysis (under which I include Calculi) require to he
entirely remodelled ; and Cauchy has done much already for this great object. Poisson also has done much ; but he does not seem to me to have nearly so logical a mind as Cauchy, great as his talents and clearness are ; and both are in myjudgment very far inferior to Fourier, whom I place at the head of the French
School of Mathematical Philosophy, even above Lagrange and Laplace, though I rank their talents above those of Cauchy and Poisson." (Life of Sir W. It. Hamilton, ii, p. 58.) t Cauchy, Exercices de Mathematiques iii, p. 160 (1828).

two constants, k and n, appear instead of one. The reasonforthis is that a body constituted from point-centres of forceinNavier's fashion has its moduli of rigidity and compressionconnected by the relation*
Actual bodies do not necessarily obey this condition; e.g.for india-rubber, k is much larger than - n ;f and there seemstoo be no reason why we should impose it on the aether. In the same year PoissonJ succeeded in solving the diffe-rential equation which had thus been shown to determinethewave-motions possible in an elastic solid. The solution, whichis both simple and elegant, may be derived as follows : Letthedisplacement vector e be resolved into two components,ofwhich one c is circuital, or satisfies the condition
div c = 0, while the other b is irrotational, or satisfies the condition
curl b = 0. The equation takes the form +
5 Vb = ' o Tlj * In order to construct a body whose elastic properties are not limited bythisequation, William John Macquorn Rankine (b. 1820, d. 1872) considered a continuous fluid in which a number of point-centres of force are situated : the fluidissupposed to be partially condensed round these centres, the elastic atmosphereofeach nucleus being retained round it by attraction. An additional volume-elasticitydue to the fluid is thus acquired ; and no relation between k and n is now necessary.Cf. Rankine's Miscellaneous Scientific Papers, pp. 81 sqq. Sir "William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), in 1889, formed a solid not obeyingNavier's condition by using pairs of dissimilar atoms. Cf. Thomson's Papers,iii, p. 395. Cf. also Baltimore Lectures, pp. 123 sqq. t It may, however, be objected that india-rubber and other bodies whichfail to fulfil Navier's relation are not true solids. On this historic controversy,cf. Todhunter and Pearson's History of Elasticity, i, p. 496. J Mem. de 1'Acad., viii (1828), p. 623. Poisson takes the equation in therestricted form given by Navier ; but this does not affect the question of wavepropagation.

The latter are* wavesof dilatation and condensation, like sound-waves ; in the c-waves, on the other hand, the medium is not dilated or condensed, but* Cf.

only distorted in a manner consistent with the preservationofaconstant density.*
The researches which have been mentioned hitherto haveall been concerned with isotropic bodies. Cauchy in 1828fextended the equations to the case of crystalline substances.This, however, he accomplished only by reverting to Navier'splan of conceiving an elastic body as a cluster of particles whichattract each other with forces depending on their distances apart;the aelotropy he accounted for by supposing the particles tobepacked more closely in some directions than in others. The general equations thus obtained for the vibrations ofanelastic solid contain twenty-one constants ; six of these dependon the initial stress, so that if the body is initially withoutstress, only fifteen constants are involved. If, retainingtheinitial stress, the medium is supposed to be symmetricalwithrespect to three mutually orthogonal planes, the twenty-oneconstants reduce to nine, and the equations which determinethe vibrations may be written in the form*

dz and two similar equations. The three constants G, H,Ire-present the stresses across planes parallel to the coordinateplanes in the undisturbed state of the aether.
* It may easily be shown that any disturbance, in either isotropic or crystallinemedia, for which the direction of vibration of the molecules lies in the wave-frontor surface of constant phase, must satisfy the equation
div 6 = 0, where e denotes the displacement ; if, on the other hand, the direction of vibrationof the molecules is perpendicular to the wave-front, the disturbance must satisfythe equation
curl e = 0. These results were proved by M. O'Brien, Trans. Camb.158 The Aether as an Elastic Solid.
The work of Green proved a stimulus not onlytoMacCullagh but to Cauchy, who now (1839) publishedyeta third theory of reflexion.* This appears to have oweditsorigin to a remark of Green's,f that the longitudinal wavemight be avoided in either of two ways namely, by supposingits velocity to be indefinitely great or indefinitely small. Greencurtly dismissed the latter alternative and adopted the former,on the ground that the equilibrium of the medium wouldbeunstable if its compressibility were negative (as it mustbeifthe velocity of longitudinal waves is to vanish). Cauchy, withoutattempting to meet Green's objection, took up the studyofamedium whose elastic constants are connected by the equationk + n = 0, so that the longitudinal vibrations have zero velocity; and showedthat if the aethereal vibrations are supposed to be executedatright angles to the plane of polarization, and if the rigidityof the aether is assumed to be the same in all media, araywhich is reflected will obey the sine-law and tangent-lawofFresnel. The boundary-conditions which he adopted in ordertoobtain this result were the continuity of the displacement eand-of its derivate 3e/9#, where the axis of x is taken at rightangles to the interface.* These are not the true boundary-conditions for general elastic solids ; but in the particular case nowunder discussion, where the rigidity is the same in thetwomedia, they yield the same equations as the conditions correctlygiven by Green.
The aether of Cauchy's third theory of reflexion is wellworthy of some further study. It is generally known as they.contractile or labile^ aether, the names being due to William* Comptes Rendus, ix, p. 676 (25 NOT., 1839), and p. 726 (2 Dec., 1839). t Green's Math. Papers, p. 246.

The Aether as an Elastic Solid. 159Thomson (Lord Kelvin), who discussed it long afterwards.* It may be defined as an elastic medium of (negative) compressibility such as to make the velocity of the longitudinal wave zero : this implies that no work is required to be donein order to give the medium any small irrotational disturbance.
An example is furnished by homogeneous foam free from air and held from collapse by adhesion to a containing vessel
Cauchy, as we have seen, did not attempt to refute Green's
objection that such a medium would be unstable ; but, as Thomson remarked, every possible infinitesimal motion of the
medium is, in the elementary dynamics of the subject, proved
to be resolvable into coexistent wave-motions. If, then, the
velocity of propagation for each of the two kinds of wave-motionis real, the equilibrium must be stable, provided the mediumeither extends through boundless space or has a fixed containing
vessel as its boundary.
When the rigidity of the luminiferous medium is supposed
to have the same value in all bodies, the conditions to be satisfied at an interface reduce to the continuity of the displacement e, of the tangential components of curl e, and of the scalar quantity (k + ^n) div e across the interface. Now we have seen that when a transverse wave is incident on an interface, it gives rise in general to reflected and refracted waves of both the transverse ajid the longitudinal species. Inthe case of the contractile aether, for which the velocity of propagation of the longitudinal waves is very small, the ordinary
construction for refracted waves shows that the directions of propagation of the reflected and refracted longitudinal waveswill be almost normal to the interface. The longitudinal waves will therefore contribute only to the component of displacement normal to the interface, not to the tangential
components : in other words, the only tangential components of displacement at the interface are those due to the three trans- verse waves the incident, reflected, and refracted. Moreover,the longitudinal waves do not contribute at all to curl e ; and,
*

160 The Aether as an Elastic Solid.
therefore, in the contractile aether, the conditions thatthetangential components of e and of n curl e shall be continuousacross an interface are satisfied by the distortional part ofthedisturbance taken alone. The condition that the componentof e normal to the interface is to be continuous is not satisfiedby the distortional part of the disturbance taken alone, butissatisfied when the distortional and congressional parts are takentogether.
The energy carried away by the longitudinal wavesisinfinitesimal, as might be expected, since no work is requiredinorder to generate an irrotational displacement. Hence,withthis aether, the behaviour of the transverse waves ataninterface may be specified without considering the irrotationalpart of the disturbance at all, by the conditions thattheconservation of energy is to hold and that the tangentialcomponents of e and of n curl e are to be continuous. Butifwe identify these transverse waves with light, assumingthatthe displacement e is at right angles to the plane of polarizationof the light, and assuming moreover that the rigidity n is thesame in all media* (the differences between media dependingondifferences in the inertia p), we have exactly the assumptionsof Fresnel's theory of light : whence it follows that transversewaves in the labile aether must obey in reflexion the sine-lawand tangent-law of Fresnel. The great advantage of the labile aether is that it overcomesthe difficulty about securing continuity of the normal component of displacement at an interface between two media:the light-waves taken alone do not satisfy this conditionofcontinuity ; but the total disturbance consisting of light-wavesand irrotational disturbance taken together does satisfyit;and this is ensured without allowing the irrotational disturbanceto carry off any of the energy. f
* This condition is in any case necessary for stability, as was shownbyR. T. Glazebrook : cf. Thomson, Phil. Mag. xxvi, p. 500. f The labile-aether theory of light may be compared with the electro-magnetictheory, by interpreting the displacement e as the electric force, and pe as theelectric displacement.
The Aether as an Elastic Solid. 161
William Thomson (Lord Kelvin, b. 1824, d. 1908), whodevoted much attention to the labile aether, was at one time
led to doubt the validity of this explanation of light* ; for wheninvestigating the radiation of energy from a vibrating rigid
globe embedded in an infinite elastic-solid aether, he found that
in some cases the irrotational waves would carry away a
considerable part of the energy if the aether were of the labile type. This difficulty, however, was removed by the observationf
that it is sufficient for the fulfilment of Fresnel's laws if the
velocity of the irrotational waves in one of the two media is very small, without regard to the other medium. Following upthis idea, Thomson assumed that in space void of ponderable
matter the aether is practically incompressible by the forces concerned in light-waves, but that in the space occupied byliquids and solids it has a negatiye_CQmpres^biIiljy, so as to give
zero velocity for longitudinal aether-waves in these bodies. This assumption was based on the conception that material
atoms move through space without displacing the aether: a
conception which, as Thomson remarked, contradicts the old
scholastic axiom that two different portions of matter cannot
simultaneously occupy the same space.J He supposed the
aether to be attracted and repelled by the atoms, and thereby to be condensed or rarefied. The year 1839, which saw the publication of MacCullagh's
dynamical theory of light and Cauchy's theory of the labile aether, was memorable also for the appearance of a memoir byGreen on crystal-bptics.H This really contains two distinct
theories, which respectively resemble Cauchy's First and Second
Theories : in one of them, the stresses in the undisturbed state

of the aether are supposed to vanish, and the vibrations of theaether are supposed to be executed parallel to the planeofpolarization of the light ; in the other theory, the initial stressesare not supposed to vanish, and the aether-vibrations areatright angles to the plane of polarization. The two investigationsare generally known as Green's First and Second Theoriesofcrystal-optics.
The foundations of both theories are, however, the same.Green first of all determined the potential energy of a strainedcrystalline solid ; this in the most general case involves27constants, or 21 if there is no initial stress.* If, however, asishere assumed, the medium possesses three planes of symmetryat right angles to each other, the number of constants reducesto. 12, or to 9 if there is no initial stress; if e denote thedis-placement, the potential energy per unit volume may be writtenfo \2 ("be \

These differ from Cauchy's fundamental equations in havinggreater generality: for Cauchy's medium was supposed to bebuilt up of point-centres of force attracting each other accordingto some function of the distance ; and, as we have seen, thereare limitations in this method of construction, which render it incompetent to represent the most general type of elastic solid. Cauchy's equations for crystalline media are, in fact, exactlyanalogous to the equations originally found by Navier for
isotropic media, which contain only one elastic constant insteadof two. The number of constants in the above equations still exceedsthe three which are required to specify the properties of abiaxal crystal : and Green now proceeds to consider how thenumber may be reduced. The condition which he imposes for
this purpose is that for two of the three waves whose front is parallel to a given plane, the vibration of the aethereal moleculesshall be accurately in the plane of the wave : in other words,that two of the three waves shall be purely distortional, theremaining one being consequently a normal vibration. Thiscondition gives five relations,* which may be written :
a. b = c =
JJK; /'-j-2/ / = M -2<7; tf- M -2fc;
where /z denotes a new constant,f
* As Green showed, the hypothesis of transversality really involves the existence of planes of symmetry, so that it alone is capable of giving 14 relations between the
21 constants : and 3 of the remaining 7 constants may be removed by change of
axes, leaving only four.
t It was afterwards shown by Barre de Saint- Venant (b. 1797, d. 1886), Journal de Math., vii (1863), p. 399, that if the initial stresses be supposed to vanish, the conditions which must be satisfied among the remaining nine constants M 2

The Aether as an Elastic Solid. 165This expression contains the correct number of constants,
namely, four: three of them represent the optical constantsof a biaxal crystal, and one (namely, ju) represents the square of the velocity of propagation of longitudinal waves. It is foundthat the two sheets of the wave-surface which correspond to thetwo distortional waves form a Fresnel's wave-surface, the thirdsheet, which corresponds to the longitudinal wave, being anellipsoid. The directions of polarization and the wave-velocities
of the distortional waves are identical with those assigned byFresnel, provided it is assumed that the direction of vibrationof the aether-particles is parallel to the plane of polarization ; but this last assumption is of course inconsistent with Green'stheory of reflexion and refraction. In his Second Theory, Green, like Cauchy, used the conditionthat for the waves whose fronts are parallel to the coordinateplanes, the wave-velocity depends only on the plane of polarization, and not on the direction of propagation. He thus obtainedthe equations already found by Cauchy
O-f-H-g-I-h.
The wave-surface in this case also is Fresnel's, provided it
is assumed that the vibrations of the aether are executed atright angles to the plane of polarization.
The principle which underlies the Second Theories of Greenand Cauchy is that the aether in a crystal resembles an elastic solid which is unequally pressed or pulled in different directionsby the unmoved ponderable matter. This idea appealed stronglyto W. Thomson (Kelvin), who long afterwards developed it further,* arriving at the following interesting result : Let anincompressible solid, isotropic when unstrained, be such that its potential energy per unit volume is P 7

q q There is some difficulty in picturing the manner in whichthe molecules of ponderable matter act upon the aether so astoproduce the initial strain required by this theory. LordKelvin utilized* the suggestion to which we have alreadyreferred, namely, that the aether may pervade the atomsofmatter so as to occupy space jointly with them, and that itsinteraction with them may consist in attractions and repulsionsexercised throughout the regions interior to the atoms. Theseforces may be supposed to be so large in comparison with thosecalled into play in free aether that the resistance to compression may be overcome, and the aether may be (say) condensedin the central region of an isolated atom, and rarefied in itsouter parts. A crystal may be supposed to consist of a groupof spherical atoms in which neighbouring spheres overlap eachother ; in the central regions of the spheres the aether will becondensed, and within the lens-shaped regions of overlappingit will be still more rarefied than in the outer parts of a solitaryatom, while in the interstices between the atoms its densitywill be unaffected. In consequence of these rarefactions andcondensations, the reaction of the aether on the atoms tendsto draw inwards the outermost atoms of the group, which,however, will be maintained in position by repulsions betweenthe atoms themselves; and thus we can account for the pullwhich, according to the present hypothesis, is exerted on theaether by the ponderable molecules of crystals.

The Aether as an Elastic Solid. 167Analysis similar to that of Cauchy's and Green's SecondTheory of crystal-optics may be applied to explain the doublyrefracting property which is possessed by strained glass ; butin this case the formulae derived are found to conflict withthe results of experiment. The discordance led Kelvin to doubt the truth of the whole theory. "After earnest andhopeful consideration of the stress theory of double refraction during fourteen years," he said,*
" I am unable to see how it can give the true explanation either of the double refraction of natural crystals, or of double refraction induced in isotropic
solids by the application of unequal pressures in different
directions." It is impossible to avoid noticing throughout all Kelvin'swork evidences of the deep impression which was madeupon him by the writings of Green. The same may be saidof Kelvin's friend and contemporary Stokes; and, indeed, it is no exaggeration to describe Green as the real founder of that " Cambridge school " of natural philosophers, of whichKelvin, Stokes, Lord Eayleigh, and Clerk Maxwell were themost illustrious members in the latter half of the nineteenthcentury, and which is now led by Sir Joseph Thomson andSir Joseph Larrnor. In order to understand the peculiarposition occupied by Green, it is necessary to recall something of the history of mathematical studies at Cambridge.
The century which elapsed between the death of Newtonand the scientific activity of Green was the darkest in thehistory of the University. It is true that Cavendish andYoung were educated at Cambridge; but they, after takingundergraduate courses, removed to London. In the entireperiod the only natural philosopher of distinction who livedand taught at Cambridge was Michell ; and for some reasonwhich at this distance of time it is difficult to understandfully, Michell's researches seem to have attracted little or noattention among his collegiate contemporaries and successors,* Baltimore Lectures (ed. 1904), p. 258.
168 The Aether as an Elastic Solid.
who silently acquiesced when his discoveries were attributedtoothers, and allowed his name to perish entirely from Cambridgetradition. A few years before Green published his first paper,anotable revival of mathematical learning swept over theUniversity ; the fluxional symbolism, which since the timeofNewton had isolated Cambridge from the continental schools,was abandoned in favour of the differential notation, andtheworks of the great French analysts were introduced andeagerly read. Green undoubtedly received his own earlyinspiration from this source ; but in clearness of physicalinsight and conciseness of exposition he far excelled hismasters ; and the slight volume of his collected papers hasto this day a charm which is wanting to the voluminouswritings of Cauchy and Poisson. It was natural that suchanexample should powerfully influence the youthful intellectsofStokes who was an undergraduate when Green read his memoiron double refraction to the Cambridge Philosophical Societyand of William Thomson (Kelvin), who came into residence twoyears afterwards.*
In spite of the advances which were made in the greatmemoirs of the year 1839, the fundamental question astowhether the aether-particles vibrate parallel or at right anglesto the plane of polarization was still unanswered. More lightwas thrown on this problem ten years later by Stokes's investigation of Diffraction.f Stokes showed that on almost anyconceivable hypothesis regarding the aether, a disturbanceinwhich the vibrations are executed at right angles to the planeof diffraction must be transmitted round the edge of an opaquebody with less diminution of intensity than a disturbance whosevibrations are executed parallel to that plane. It follows thatwhen light, of which the vibrations are oblique to the planeof*It was in the year Thomson took his degree (1845) that he bought, and readwith delight, the electrical memoir which Green had published at Nottinghamin1828.f Trans.

The Aether as an Elastic Solid. 169diffraction, is so transmitted, the plane of vibration will be morenearly at right angles to the plane of diffraction in the diffracted than in the incident light. Stokes himself performed experiments to test the matter, using a grating in order to obtain
strong light diffracted at a large angle, and found that whenthe plane of polarization of the incident light was oblique to the
plane of diffraction, the plane of polarization of the diffracted
light was more nearly parallel to the plane of diffraction. This
result, which was afterwards confirmed by L. Lorenz,* appeared
to confirm decisively the hypothesis of Fresnel, that the vibrations of the aethereal particles are executed at right angles to the plane of polarization.
Three years afterwards Stokes indicatedf a second line of proof leading to the same conclusion. It had long been knownthat the blue light of the sky, which is due to the scattering of the sun's direct rays by small particles or molecules in the
-atmosphere, is partly polarized. The polarization is mostmarked when the light comes from a part of the sky distant 90
from the sun, in which case it must have been scattered in a
direction perpendicular to that of the direct sunlight incident on the small particles ; and the polarization is in the plane
through the sun.
If, then, the axis of y be taken parallel to the light incident on a small particle at the origin, and the scattered light be
observed along the axis of x, this scattered light is found to be
polarized in the plane xy. Considering the matter from the
dynamical point of view, we may suppose the material particle
to possess so much inertia (compared to the aether) that it is practically at rest. Its motion relative to the aether, which is the cause of the disturbance it creates in the aether, will therefore be in the same line as the incident aethereal vibration,
but in the opposite direction. The disturbance must be
transversal, and must therefore be zero in a polar direction and* Ann. d. Phj-s. exi (1860), p. 315. Phil. Mag. xxi (1861), p. 321. t Phil. Trans., 1852, p. 463. Stokes's Math, and Phys. Papers, iii, p. 267.

a maximum in an equatorial direction, its amplitude being,infact, proportional to the sine of the polar distance. The polarline must, by considerations of symmetry, be the line of theincident vibration. Thus we see that none of the light scatteredin the ^-direction can come from that constituent of the incidentlight which vibrates parallel to the o>axis ; so the light observedin this direction must consist of vibrations parallel to the 2-axis.But we have seen that the plane of polarization of the scatteredlight is the plane of xy ; and therefore the vibration is at rightangles to the plane of polarization.*
The phenomena of diffraction and of polarization by scatter-ing thus agreed in confirming the result arrived at in Fresnel'sand Green's theory of reflexion. The chief difficulty in acceptingit arose in connexion with the optics of crystals. As wehaveseen, Green and Cauchy were unable to reconcile the hypothesisof aethereal vibrations at right angles to the plane of polarization with the correct formulae of crystal-optics, at any ratesolong as the aether within crystals was supposed to be free frominitial stress. The underlying reason for this can be readilyseen. In a crystal, where the elasticity is different in differentdirections, the resistance to distortion depends solely ontheorientation of the plane of distortion, which in the case of lightis the plane through the directions of propagation and vibration.Now it is known that for light propagated parallel to one oftheaxes of elasticity of a crystal, the velocity of propagationdepends only on the plane of polarization of the light, beingthesame whichever of the two axes lying in that plane is thedirection of propagation. Comparing these results, we seethatthe plane of polarization must be the plane of distortion,andtherefore the vibrations of the aether-particles must be executedparallel to the plane of polarization.f
* The theory of polarization by small particles was afterwards investigatedbyLord Rayleigh, Phil. Mag. xli(187l). fin Fresnel's theory of crystal-optics, in which the aether-vibrations areatright angles to the plane of polarization, the velocity of propagation dependsonlyon the direction of vibration, not on the plane through this and the directionoftransmission.
The Aether as an Elastic Solid. 171A way of escape from this conclusion suggested itself to Stokes,* and later to Eankinet and Lord Kayleigh.J; What if the
aether in a crystal, instead of having its elasticity different in
different directions, were to have its rigidity invariable and its inertia different in different directions ? This would bring the
theory of crystal-optics into complete agreement with Fresnel's and Green's theory of reflexion, in which the optical differences between media are attributed to differences of inertia of the
aether contained within them. The only difficulty lies in conceiving how aelotropy of inertia can exist; and all three
writers overcame this obstacle by pointing out that a solid which is immersed in a fluid may have its effective inertia
different in different directions. For instance, a coin immersedin water moves much more readily in its own plane than in the
direction at right angles to this. Suppose then that twice the kinetic energy per unit volumeof the aether within a crystal is represented by the expression
and that the potential energy per unit volume has the samevalue as in space void of ordinary matter. The aether is assumed to be incompressible, so that div e is zero : the potential
energy per unit volume is therefore

where n denotes as usual the rigidity.

The Aether as an Elastic Solid. 173The hypothesis that in crystals the inertia depends ondirection seemed therefore to be discredited when the theorybased on it was compared with the results of observation. Butwhen, in 1888, W. Thomson (Lord Kelvin) revived Cauchy'stheory of the labile aether, the question naturally arose as to whether that theory could be extended so as to account for the
optical properties of crystals : and it was shown by E. T. Glazebrook* that the correct formulae of crystal-optics ar&obtained when the Cauchy-Thomson hypothesis of zero velocity
for the longitudinal wave is combined with the Stokes-KankineRayleigh hypothesis of aelotropic inertia. For on reference to the formulae which have been already
given, it is obvious that the equation of motion of an aether
having these properties must be
(pie*, pzey, p3O = -n curl curl e, where e denotes the displacement, n the rigidity, and (plt p2 , /o3) the inertia : and this equation leads by the usual analysis ta
Fresnel's wave-surface. The displacement e of the aethereal
particles is not, however, accurately in the wave-front, as in Fresnel's theory, but is at right angles to the direction of theray, in the plane passing through the ray and the wavenormal,f
Having now traced the progress of the elastic-solid theory
so far as it is concerned with the propagation of light in ordinary isotropic media and in crystals, we must consider the
attempts which were made about this time to account for the
optical properties of a more peculiar class of substances.
It was found by Arago in 181 IJ that the state of polarization of a beam of light is altered when the beam is passed through a plate of quartz along the optic axis. The* Phil. Mag. xxvi (1888), p. 521 ; xxviii (1889), p. 110. t This theory of crystal-optics may be assimilated to the electro-magnetic theory

phenomenon was studied shortly afterwards by Biot,* whoshowed that the alteration consists in a rotation of the planeofpolarization about the direction of propagation : the angleofrotation is proportional to the thickness of the plate andinversely proportional to the square of the wave-length.
In some specimens of quartz the rotation is from lefttoright, in others from right to left. This distinction was shownby Sir John Herschelf (b. 1792, d. 1871) in 1820 tobeassociated with differences in the crystalline form of thespecimens, the two types bearing the same relation to eachother as a right-handed and left-handed helix respectively.FresnelJ and W. Thomsong proposed the term helicaltodenote the property of rotating the plane of polarization,exhibited by such bodies as quartz : the less appropriate termnatural rotatory polarization is, however, generally used.|| Biot showed that many liquid organic bodies, e.g. turpentineand sugar solutions, possess the natural rotatory property: wemight be led to infer the presence of a helical structureinthe molecules of such substances ; and this inference is supported by the study of their chemical constitution; for theyare invariably of the "mirror-image" or "enantiomorphous"type, in which one of the atoms (generally carbon) is asymmetrically linked to other atoms. The next advance in the subject was due to Fresnel,1[ whoshowed that in naturally active bodies the velocity of propagation of circularly polarized light is different according asthepolarization is right-handed or left-handed. Fromthisproperty the rotation of the plane of polarization of a planepolarized ray may be immediately deduced ; for the planepolarized ray may be resolved into two rays circularly polarizedin opposite senses, and these advance in phase by different* Mem. de 1'Institut, 1812, Part i, p. 218, sqq. ; Annales de Chim., ix (1818),p. 372; x (1819), p. 63. tCamb.

capable of resolution into two plane-polarized components
which differ in phase by a definite amount. The directions of these refracted rays may be determined by Huygens' construction, provided the wave-surface is supposed to consist of a sphere and spheroid which do not touch. The first attempt to frame a theory of naturally active
bodies was made by MacCullagh in 1836.* Suppose a plane wave of light to be propagated within a crystal of quartz. Let
(#, ?/, z) denote the coordinates of a vibrating molecule, whenthe axis of x is taken at right angles to the plane of the wave,
and the axis of z at right angles to the axis of the
crystal. Using Fand Zto denote the displacements parallel to the axes of y and z respectively at any time t, MacCullaghassumed that the differential equations which determine Yand

If we neglect the variation of Ci with the period of the light,this expression satisfies Biot's law that the angle of rotationin unit length of path is proportional to the inverse squareofthe wave-length.
MacCullagh's investigation can be scarcely called a theory,for it amounts only to a reduction of the phenomenatoempirical, though mathematical, laws ; but it was onthisfoundation that later workers built the theory which is nowaccepted.*

Neumann showed that the equations may be derived fromthehypothesis that the relative displacement of one aethereal particle with respecttoanother acts on the latter according to the same law as an element of an electriccurrent acts on a magnetic pole.

The Aether as an Elastic Solid. 177The great investigators who developed the theory of light after the death of Fresnel devoted considerable attention to the optical properties of metals. Their researches in this direction must now be reviewed.
The most striking properties of metals are the power of
brilliantly reflecting light at all angles of incidence, which is so well shown by the mirrors of reflecting telescopes, and the
opacity, which causes a train of waves to be extinguished before
it has proceeded many wave-lengths into a metallic medium.That these two attributes are connected appears probable
from the fact that certain non- metallic bodies e.g., aniline
dyes which strongly absorb the rays in certain parts of the
spectrum, reflect those rays with almost metallic brilliance. A third quality in which metals differ from transparent bodies,
and which, as we shall see, is again closely related to the other
two, is in regard to the polarization of the light reflected fromthem. This was first noticed by Malus ; and in 1830 Sir DavidBrewster* showed that plane-polarized light incident on a
metallic surface remains polarized in the same plane after reflexion if its polarization is either parallel or perpendicularto the plane of reflexion, but that in other cases the reflected light is polarized elliptically. It was this discovery of Brewster's which suggested to the
mathematicians a theory of metallic reflexion. For, as we haveseen, elliptic polarization is obtained when plane-polarized
light is totally reflected at the surface of a transparent body ; and this analogy between the effects of total reflexion andmetallic reflexion led to the surmise that the latter pheno-menon might be treated in the same way as Fresnel had treated
the former, namely, by introducing imaginary quantities into the formulae of ordinary reflexion. On these principles mathematical formulae were devised by MacCullaghf and Cauchy^

To explain their method, we shall suppose the incidentlight to be polarized in the plane of incidence. AccordingtoFresnel's sine-law, the amplitude of the light (polarized in thisway) reflected from a transparent body is to the amplitudeofthe incident light in the ratio _
sin (i -
r) sin (i + r)' where i denotes the angle of incidence and r is determined fromthe equation
sin i = ft sin r. MacCullagh and Cauchy assumed that these equations hold goodalso for reflexion at a metallic surface, provided the refractiveindex /* is replaced by a complex quantity

The Aether as an Elastic Solid. 179The quantities J and S are interpreted in the same way as
in Fresnel's theory of total reflexion : that is, we take J to mean the ratio of the intensities of the reflected and incident
light, while 3 measures the change of phase experienced bythe light in reflexion. The case of light polarized at right angles to the plane of incidence may be treated in the same way.
When the incidence is perpendicular, U evidently reducesto v (1 + K
2)*, and u reduces to - tan -1
K. For silver at perpen2 dicular incidence almost all the light is reflected, so J is nearlyunity : this requires cos v to be small, and K to be very large.
The extreme case in which K is indefinitely great but v indefinitely
small, so that the quasi-index of refraction is a pure imaginary,is generally known as the case of ideal silver. The physical significance of the two constants v and K wasmore or less distinctly indicated by Cauchy; in fact, as thedifference between metals and transparent bodies depends onthe constant K, it is evident that K must in some way measurethe opacity of the substance. This will be more clearly seen if we inquire how the elastic-solid theory of light can be extendedso as to provide a physical basis for the formulae of MacCullaghand Cauchy.* The sine-formula of Fresnel, which was thestarting-point of our investigation of metallic reflexion, is aconsequence of Green's elastic-solid theory : and the differences between Green's results and those which we have derived arise solely from the complex value which we have assumed for yu. We have therefore to modify Green's theory in such a way as
to obtain a complex value for the index of refraction. Take the plane of incidence as plane of xy, and the metallic
surface as plane of yz. If the light is polarized in the plane of incidence, so that the light-vector is parallel to the axis of z, the incident light may be taken to be a function of theargument

This equation of motion differs from that of a Greenian
The Aether as an Elastic Solid. 181elastic solid by reason of the occurrence of the term in dez/dt. But this is evidently a
" viscous
" term, representing something
like a frictional dissipation of the energy of luminous vibrations : a dissipation which, in fact, occasions the opacity of the
metal. Thus the term which expresses opacity in the equation
of motion of the luminiferous medium appears as the origin of the
peculiarities of metallic reflexion.* It is curious to notice howclosely this accords with the idea of Huygens, that metals are characterized by the presence of soft particles which damp the
vibrations of light.
There is, however, one great difficulty attending this explanation of metallic reflexion, which was first pointed out byLord Rayleigh.f We have seen that for ideal silver ^ is real and negative : and therefore A must be zero and p negative ; that is to say, the inertia of the luminiferous medium in the
metal must be negative. This seems to destroy entirely the
physical intelligibility of the theory as applied to the case of ideal silver. The difficulty is a deep-seated one, and was not overcomefor many years. The direction in which the true solution lies will suggest itself when we consider the resemblance whichhas already been noticed between metals and those substances
which show "surface colour" e.g. the aniline dyes. In the
case of the latter substances, the light which is so copiously
reflected from them lies within a restricted part of the spectrum ; and it therefore seems probable that the phenomenon is not
to be attributed to the existence of dissipative terms, but that
it belongs rather to the same class of effects as dispersion,
and is to be referred to the same causes. In fact, dispersion means that the value of the refractive index of a substance
with respect to any kind of light depends on the period of the light ; and we have only to suppose that the physical causes which operate in dispersion cause the refractive index*
It is easily seen that the amplitude is reduced by the factor e-* when light
travels one wave-length in the metal : K is generally called the coefficient of
absorption. 1" Loc. cit.

to become imaginary for certain kinds of light, in ordertoexplain satisfactorily both the surface colours of the anilinedyes and the strong reflecting powers of the metals. Dispersion was the subject of several memoirs bythefounders of the elastic-solid theory. So early as 1830 Cauchy'sattention was directed* to the possibility of constructingamathematical theory of this phenomenon on the basisofFresnel's " Hypothesis of Finite Impacts "f i.e. the assumptionthat the radius of action of one particle of the luminiferousmedium on its neighbours is so large as to be comparable withthe wave-length of light. Cauchy supposed the mediumtobe formed, as in Navier's theory of elastic solids, of a systemof point-centres of force : the force between two of thesepoint-centres, m at (x, y, z), and //, at (x + A#, y + Ay, z +Az),may be denoted by m^/(r), where r denotes the distance betweenm and p.

in the differential equation with these higher derivates retained,we have
'2-irV
which shows that cb the velocity of the light in the medium,depends on the wave-length A ; as it should do in order toexplain dispersion.
Dispersion is, then, according to the view of Fresnel andCauchy, a consequence of the coarse-grainedness of the medium.Since the luminiferous medium was found to be dispersive onlywithin material bodies, it seemed natural to suppose that in these bodies the aether is loaded by the molecules of matter,and that dispersion depends essentially on the ratio of thewave-length to the distance between adjacent material molecules.
184 The Aether as an Elastic Solid.
This theory, in one modification or another, held its grounduntil forty years later it was overthrown by the factsofanomalous dispersion.
The distinction between aether and ponderable matterwasmore definitely drawn in memoirs which were publishedindependently in 1841-2 by F. E. Neumann* and MatthewO'Brien.f These authors supposed the ponderable particlestoremain sensibly at rest while the aether surges round them,andis acted on by them with forces which are proportional toitsdisplacement.

The Aether as an Elastic Solid. 185before the electromagnetic hypothesis had attracted muchattention, an elastic-solid theory in many respects preferable
to its predecessors was presented to the French Academy* byJoseph Boussinesq (b. 1842). Until this time, as we haveseen, investigators had been divided into two parties, according
as they attributed the optical properties of different bodies to variations in the inertia of the luminiferous medium, or to variations in its elastic properties. Boussinesq, taking up a
position apart from both these schools, assumed that the aether
is exactly the same in all material bodies as in interplanetary
space, in regard both to inertia and to rigidity, and that the
optical properties of matter are due to interaction between the
aether and the material particles, as had been imagined more or
less by Neumann and O'Brien. These material particles hesupposed to be disseminated in the aether, in much the sameway as dust-particles floating in the air. If e denote the displacement at the point (x, y, z) in the
aether, and e' the displacement of the ponderable particles at the same place, the equation of motion of the aether is

So far therewould seem to be nothing very new in Boussinesq's work. Butwhen we proceed to consider crystal-optics, dispersion, androtatory polarization, the advantage of his method becomesevident: he retains equation (1) as a formula universally trueat any rate for bodies at rest while equation (2) is variedto suit the circumstances of the case. Thus dispersion canbeexplained if, instead of equation (2), we take the relation
e' = Ae - Z>V2 e, where D is a constant which measures the dispersive powerofthe substance : the rotation of the plane of polarization of sugarsolutions can be explained if we suppose that in these bodiesequation (2) is replaced by
e' = AQ + B curl e, where B is a constant which measures the rotatory power; andthe optical properties of crystals can be explained if we supposethat for them equation (2) is to be replaced by the equationsex
' = Atfx, ey = Az e

' = A3e, When these values for the components of e' are substitutedin equation (1), we evidently obtain the same formulae as werederived from the Stokes-Eankine-Eayleigh hypothesis of inertiadifferent in different directions in a crystal; to which Boussinesq'stheory of crystal-optics is practically equivalent.

It is Boussinesq's merit to have clearly asserted that all space, both within and without ponderable bodies, is occupied
by one identical aether, the same everywhere both in inertia and elasticity; and that all aethereal processes are to be re- presented by two kinds of equations, of which one kind expresses
the invariable equations of motion of the aether, while the other
kind expresses the interaction between aether and matter. Many years afterwards these ideas were revived in connexion
with the electromagnetic theory, in the modern forms of whichthey are indeed of fundamental importance.

CHAPTEK VI.
FAKADAY.
TOWARDS the end of the year 1812, Davy received a letterinwhich the writer, a bookbinder's journeyman named MichaelFaraday, expressed a desire to escape from trade, and obtainemployment in a scientific laboratory. With the letter wasenclosed a neatly written copy of notes which the youngmanhe was twenty-one years of age had made of Davy's ownpublic lectures. The great chemist replied courteously, andarranged an interview ; at which he learnt that his correspondent had educated himself by reading the volumes which cameinto his hands for binding. "There were two," Faradaywrote later, "that especially helped me, the 'EncyclopaediaBritannica,' from which I gained my first notions of electricity,and Mrs. Marcet's ' Conversations on Chemistry/ which gaveme my foundation in that science." Already, before his application to Davy, he had performed a number of chemicalexperiments, and had made for himself a voltaic pile, withwhich he had decomposed several compound bodies. At Davy's recommendation Faraday was in the followingspring appointed to a post in the laboratory of the KoyalInstitution, which had been established at the close of theeighteenth century under the auspices of Count Rumford; andhere he remained for the whole of his active life, first asassistant, then as director of the laboratory, and from 1833onwards as the occupant of a chair of chemistry whichwasfounded for his benefit. For many years Faraday was directly under Davy's influence,and was occupied chiefly in chemical investigations. Butin1821, when the new field of inquiry opened by Oersted's
Faraday. 189discovery was attracting attention, he wrote an Historical Sketch of Electro-Magnetism* as a preparation for which hecarefully repeated the experiments described by the writers hewas reviewing ; and this seems to have been the beginning of the researches to which his fame is chiefly due. The memoir which stands first in the published volumes of Faraday's electrical workf was communicated to the RoyalSociety on November 24th, 1831. The investigation wasinspired, as he tells us, by the hope of discovering analogies
between the behaviour of electricity as observed in motion in
currents, and the behaviour of electricity at rest on conductors.
Static electricity was known to possess the power of " induction "
i.e., of causing an opposite electrical state on bodies in its neighbourhood ; was it not possible that electric currents mightshow a similar property ? The idea at first was that if in anycircuit a current were made to flow, any adjacent circuit wouldbe traversed by an induced current, which would persist exactly
as long as the inducing current. Faraday found that this wasnot the case ; a current was indeed induced, but it lasted only
for an instant, being in fact perceived only when the primarycurrent was started or stopped. It depended, as he soon convinced himself, not on the mere existence of the inducing
current, but on its variation. Faraday now set himself to determine the laws of induction
of currents, and for this purpose devised a new way of repre- senting the state of a magnetic field. Philosophers had beenlong accustomed? to illustrate magnetic power by strewing iron
filings on a sheet of paper, and observing the curves in whichthey dispose themselves when a magnet is brought underneath.

traced by Petrus Peregrinus on his globular lodestone (cf . p. 8) were projections
of lines of force. Among eighteenth-century writers La Hire mentions the use of
iron filings, Mem. de 1'Acad., 1717. Faraday had referred to them in his electro- magnetic paper of 1821, Exp. Res. ii, p. 127.
190 Faraday.
These curves suggested to Faraday* the idea of lines of magneticforce, or curves whose direction at every point coincides withthe direction of the magnetic intensity at that point;thecurves in which the iron filings arrange themselves onthepaper resemble these curves so far as is possible subject tothecondition of not leaving the plane of the paper. With these lines of magnetic force Faraday conceivedallspace to be filled. Every line of force is a closed curve, whichin some part of its course passes through the magnet to whichit belongs, f Hence if any small closed curve be taken in space,the lines of force which intersect this curve must formatubular surface returning into itself ; such a surface is calledatiibe offorce. From a tube of force we may derive informationnot only regarding the direction of the magnetic intensity,but also regarding its magnitude; for the product of thismagnitude} and the cross-section of any tube is constant alongthe entire length of the tube. On the basis of this result,Faraday conceived the idea of partitioning all space intocompartments by tubes, each tube being such that this producthas the same definite value. For simplicity, each of thesetubes may be called a
" unit line of force
"
; the strengthofthe field is then indicated by the separation or concentrationofthe unit lines of force,! I so that the number of them whichintersect a unit area placed at right angles to their direction#They were first defined in Exp. Res., 114 : "By magnetic curves, I meanthe lines of magnetic forces, however modified hy the juxtaposition of poles,which could be depicted by iron filings ; or those to which a very small magneticneedle would form a tangent." t Exp. Res. iii, p. 405. J Within the substance of magnetized bodies we must in this connexion understand the magnetic intensity to be that experienced in a crevice whose sidesareperpendicular to the lines of magnetization : in other words, we must take it tobewhat since Maxwell's time has been called the magnetic induction.

at any point measures the intensity of the magnetic field at that point.
Faraday constantly thought in terms of lines of force.
"
I cannot refrain," he wrote, in 1851,*
" from again expressing
my conviction of the truthfulness of the representation, which
the idea of lines of force affords in regard to magnetic action. All the points which are experimentally established in regard
to that action i.e. all that is not hypothetical appear to be well
and truly represented by it."f Faraday found that a current is induced in a circuit either
when the strength of an adjacent current is altered, or when a magnet is brought near to the circuit, or when the circuit itself
is moved about in presence of another current or a magnet.
He saw from the firstj that in all cases the induction depends on the relative motion of the circuit and the lines of magnetic
force in its vicinity. The precise nature of this dependence was the subject of long-continued further experiments. In
1832 he found that the currents produced by induction under
the same circumstances in different wires are proportional to the conducting powers of the wires a result which showedthat the induction consists in the production of a definite electromotive force, independent of the nature of the wire, anddependent only on the intersections of the wire and the
magnetic curves. This electromotive force is produced whether
the wire forms a closed circuit (so that a current flows) or is open (so that electric tension results).
All that now remained was to inquire in what way the
electromotive force depends on the relative motion of the wire
and the lines of force. The answer to this inquiry is, in * Exp. Res., 3174. t Some of Faraday's most distinguished contemporaries were far from sharing
this conviction. " I declare," wrote Sir George Airy in 1855, " that I can hardly
imagine anyone who practically and numerically knows this agreement " between
observation and the results of calculation based on action at a distance, "to hesitate au instant in the choice between this simple and precise action, on the one hand, and anything so vague and varying as lines of force, on the other hand." Cf. Bence Jones's Life of Faraday, ii, p. 353.
I Exp. Res., 116. Ibid., 213.
192 Faraday.
Faraday's own words,* that "whether the wire moves directlyorobliquely across the lines of force, in one direction or another,itsums up the amount of the forces represented by the linesithas crossed," so that " the quantity of electricity thrown intoacurrent is directly as the number of curves intersected."t Theinduced electromotive force is, in fact, simply proportionaltothe number of the unit lines of magnetic force intersectedbythe wire per second. This is the fundamental principle of the inductionofcurrents. Faraday is undoubtedly entitled to the full honourof its discovery ; but for a right understanding of the progressof electrical theory at this period, it is necessary to rememberthat many years elapsed before all the conceptions involvedinFaraday's principle became clear and familiar to his contemporaries ; and that in the meantime the problem of formulatingthe laws of induced currents was approached with success fromother points of view. There were indeed many obstacles to thedirect appropriation of Faraday's work by the mathematicalphysicists of his own generation ; not being himself a mathematician, he was unable to address them in their own language;and his favourite mode of representation by moving linesofforce repelled analysts who had been trained in the schoolofLaplace and Poisson. Moreover, the idea of electromotive forceitself, which had been applied to currents a few years previouslyin Ohm's memoir, was, as we have seen, still involvedinobscurity and misapprehension.
A curious question which arose out of Faraday's theorywas whether a bar-magnet which is rotated on its ownaxiscarries its lines of magnetic force in rotation with it. Faradayhimself believed that the lines of force do not rotate J: onthisview a revolving magnet like the earth is to be regardedasmoving through its own lines of force, so that it must becomecharged at the equator and poles with electricity of oppositesigns ; and if a wire not partaking in the earth's rotation wereto have sliding contact with the earth at a pole and at the* Exp. Res., 3082. t Ibid., 3115. % Ibid., 3090.
Faraday. 193equator, a current would steadily flow through it. Experiments
confirmatory of these views were made by Faraday himself ;* but they do not strictly prove his hypothesis that the lines of force remain at rest ; for it is easily seenf that, if they were to
rotate, that part of the electromotive force which would be
produced by. their rotation would be derivable from a potential,
and so would produce no effect in closed circuits such as Faraday
used.Three years after the commencement of Faraday's researches on induced currents he was led to an important extension of them by an observation which was communicated to him byanother worker. William Jenkin had noticed that anelectric shock may be obtained with no more powerful source of
electricity than a single cell, provided the wire through whichthe current passes is long and coiled ; the shock being felt whencontact is broken.J As Jenkin did not choose to investigate
the matter further, Faraday took it up, and showed that the
powerful momentary current, which was observed when the
circuit was interrupted, was really an induced current governedby the same laws as all other induced currents, but with this peculiarity, that the induced and inducing currents now flowed
in the same circuit. In fact, the current in its steady state
establishes in the surrounding region a magnetic field, whoselines of force are linked with the circuit ; and the removal of these lines of force when the circuit is broken originates aninduced current, which greatly reinforces the primary current
just before its final extinction. To this phenomenon the nameof self-induction has been given.

occasioned a comment from Faraday on the number of suggestions which were continually being laid before him. Here-marked that although at different times a large numberofauthors had presented him with their ideas, this case ofJenkin was the only one in which any result had followed." The volunteers are serious embarrassments generally to theexperienced philosopher."*
The discoveries of Oersted, Ampere, and Faraday had shownthe close connexion of magnetic with electric science. Buttheconnexion of the different branches of electric science witheach other was still not altogether clear. Although Wollaston'sexperiments of 1801 had in effect proved the identity in kindof the currents derived from frictional and voltaic sources, thequestion was still regarded as open thirty years afterwards,fnosatisfactory explanation being forthcoming of the fact thatfrictional electricity appeared to be a surface-phenomenon,whereas voltaic electricity was conducted within the interiorsubstance of bodies. To this question Faraday now applied himself; and in 1833 he succeeded* in showing that every knowneffect of electricity physiological, magnetic, luminous, calorific,chemical, and mechanical may be obtained indifferently eitherwith the electricity which is obtained by friction or with thatobtained from a voltaic battery. Henceforth the identity of thetwo was beyond dispute.
Some misapprehension, however, has existed among laterwriters as to the conclusions which may be drawn from thisidentification. What Faraday proved is that the process whichgoes on in a wire connecting the terminals of a voltaic cell is ofthe same nature as the process which for a short time goes onina wire by which a condenser is discharged. He did not prove,* Bence Jones's Life of Faraday, ii, p. 45. t Cf. John Davy, Phil. Trans., 1832, p. 259 ; W. Ritchie, ibid., p. 279. Davysuggested that the electrical power, "

Faraday. 195and did not profess to have proved, that this process consists in the actual movement of a quasi-substance, electricity, from one
plate of the condenser to the other, or of two quasi-substances,
the resinous and vitreous electricities, in opposite directions. The process had been pictured in this way by many of his predecessors, notably by Volta; and it has since been so pictured by most of his successors : but from such assumptions
Faraday himself carefully abstained.
What is common to all theories, and is universally conceded,
is that the rate of increase in the total quantity of electrostatic charge within any volume-element is equal to the excess of the
influx over the efflux of current from it. This statement maybe represented by the equation
|+divi
= 0, (1)
where p denotes the volume-density of electrostatic charge,
and i the current, at the place (x, y, z) at the time t. Volta's
assumption is really one way of interpreting this equation
physically: it presents itself when we compare equation (1)
with the equation
which is the equation of continuity for a fluid of density p andvelocity v : we may identify the two equations by supposing i to be of the same physical nature as the product /v; andthis is precisely what is done by those who accept Volta's assumption.
But other assumptions might be made which would equally
well furnish physical interpretations to equation (1). Forinstance, if we suppose p
to be the convergence of any vector of which i is the time-flux,* equation (1) is satisfied automatically ; * In symbols,
div 8 = - ,
where s denotes the vector in question. 02
196 Faraday. we can picture this vector as being of the nature of a displacement. By such an assumption we should avoid altogether thenecessity for regarding the conduction-current as an actualflow of electric charges, or for speculating whether the driftingcharges are positive or negative ; and there would be no longeranything surprising in the production of a null effect bythecoalescence of electric charges of opposite signs.
Faraday himself wished to leave the matter open, andtoavoid any definite assumption.* Perhaps the best indicationofhis views is afforded by a laboratory notej- of date 1837 : "After much consideration of the manner in which theelectric forces are arranged in the various phenomena generally,.I have come to certain conclusions which I will endeavourtonote down without committing myself to any opinion as to thecause of electricity, i.e., as to the nature of the power. Ifelectricity exist independently of matter, then I think that thehypothesis of one fluid will not stand against that of two fluids.There are, I think, evidently what I may call two elementsofpower, of equal force and acting toward each other. But thesepowers may be distinguished only by direction, and may benomore separate than the north and south forces in the elementsof a magnetic needle. They may be the polar points of theforces originally placed in the particles of matter."
It may be remarked that since the rise of the mathematicaltheory of electrostatics, the controversy between the supportersof the one-fluid and the two-fluid theories had becomemanifestly barren. The analytical equations, in whichinterest was now largely centred, could be interpreted equallywell on either hypothesis; and there seemed to be littleprospect of discriminating between them by any new experimental discovery. But a problem does not lose its fascination*"His principal aim," said Helmholtz in the Faraday Lecture of 1881," was to express in his new conceptions only facts, with the least possible use ofhypothetical substances and forces. This was really a progress in generalscientific method, destined to purify science from the last remains of metaphysics." t Bence Jones's Life of Foradny^ ii, p. 77.
Faraday. 197because it appears insoluble. " I said once to Faraday," wroteStokes to his father-in-law in 1879,
" as I sat beside him at aBritish Association dinner, that I thought a great step wouldbe made when we should be able to say of electricity thatwhich we say of light, in saying that it consists of undulations. He said to me he thought we were a long way off thatyet."*
For his next series of researches,! Faraday reverted tosubjects which had been among the first to attract him as anapprentice attending Davy's lectures : the voltaic pile, and therelations of electricity to chemistry.
It was at this time generally supposed that the decomposition of a solution, through which an electric current is passed,is due primarily to attractive and repellent forces exercised onits molecules by the metallic terminals at which the currententers and leaves the solution. Such forces had been assumedboth in the hypothesis of Grothuss and Davy, and in the rivalhypothesis of De La Eive ;+ the chief difference between thesebeing that whereas Grothuss and Davy supposed a chain 'ofdecompositions and recompositions in the liquid, De La Rivesupposed the molecules adjacent to the terminals to be theonly ones decomposed, and attributed to their fragments thepower of travelling through the liquid from one terminal to theother.To test this doctrine of the influence of terminals, Faradaymoistened a piece of paper in a saline solution, and supportedit in the air on wax, so as to occupy part of the intervalbetween two needle-points which were connected with anelectric machine. When the machine was worked, the currentwas conveyed between the needle-points by way of themoistened paper and the two air-intervals on either side of it ; and under these circumstances it was found that the salt underwent decomposition. Since in this case no metallic terminals of.any kind were in contact with the solution, it was evident that* Stokes's Scientific Correspondence, vol. i, p. 353. t Exp. Res., 450 (1833). Cf. pp. 78-9.
198 Faraday.
all hypotheses which attributed decomposition to the actionofthe terminals were untenable.
The ground being thus cleared by the demolition of previoustheories, Faraday was at liberty to construct a theory of hisown. He retained one of the ideas of Grothuss' and Davy'sdoctrine, namely, that a chain of decompositions and recombinations takes place in the liquid ; but these molecular processeshe attributed not to any action of the terminals, but to a powerpossessed by the electric current itself, at all places in itscourse through the solution. If as an example we considerneighbouring molecules A, B, C, D, . . . of the compound saywater, which was at that time believed to be directly decomposed by the current Faraday supposed that before thepassage of the current the hydrogen of A would be in closeunion with the oxygen of A, and also in a less close relation withthe oxygen atoms of B, C, D, . . . : these latter relations beingconjectured to be the cause of the attraction of aggregationinsolids and fluids.* When an electric current is sent throughtheliquid, the affinity of the hydrogen of A for the oxygen of Bisstrengthened, if A and B lie along the direction of the current;while the hydrogen of A withdraws some of its bonds fromtheoxygen of A, with which it is at the moment combined. Solong as the hydrogen and oxygen of A remain in association,the state thus induced is merely one of polarization ; but thecompound molecule is unable to stand the strain thus imposedon it, and the hydrogen and oxygen of A part company fromeach other. Thus decompositions take place, followed byrecombinations : with the result that after each exchangeanoxygen atom associates itself with a partner nearer to thepositive terminal, while a hydrogen atom associates withapartner nearer to the negative terminal.
This theory explains why, in all ordinary cases, the evolvedsubstances appear only at the terminals ; for the terminals arethe limiting surfaces of the decomposing substance ; and, exceptat them, every particle finds other particles having a contrary*Exp. lies., 523.
Faraday. 199tendency with which it can combine. It also explains why, innumerous cases, the atoms of the evolved substances are notretained by the terminals (an obvious difficulty in the way ofall theories which suppose the terminals to attract the atoms): for the evolved substances v are expelled from the liquid, notdrawn out by an attraction. Many of the perplexities which had harassed the oldertheories were at once removed when the phenomena were re-garded from Faraday's point of view. Thus, mere mixtures (asopposed to chemical compounds) are not separated into theirconstituents by the electric current ; although there would seemto be no reason why the Grothuss-Davy polar attraction shouldnot operate as well on elements contained in mixtures as onelements contained in compounds.
In the latter part of the same year (1833) Faraday took upthe subject again.* It was at this time that he introduced theterms which have ever since been generally used to describethe phenomena of electro-chemical decomposition. To theterminals by which the electric current passes into or out of thedecomposing body he gave the name electrodes. The electrodeof high potential, at which oxygen, chlorine, acids, &c., areevolved, he called the anode, and the electrode of low potential,at which metals, alkalis, and bases are evolved, the cathode.Those bodies which are decomposed directly by the currenthe named electrolytes ; the parts into which they are decomposed,ions ; the acid ions, which travel to the anode, he named anions; and the metallic ions, which pass to the cathode, cations. Faraday now proceeded to test the truth of a suppositionwhich he had published rather more than a year previously,f
and which indeed had apparently been suspected by Gay-Lussacand ThenardJ so early as 1811; namely, that the rate at whichan electrolyte is decomposed depends solely on the intensity ofthe electric current passing through it, and not at all on thesize of the electrodes or the strength of the solution. Having* Exp. Res., 661. f /*'*., 377 (Dec. 1832). Recherches physico-chimiqucs faites sur la pile ; Paris, 1811, p. 12.

established the accuracy of this law,* he found by a comparisonof different electrolytes that the mass of any ion liberated bya given quantity of electricity is proportional to its chemicalequivalent, i.e. to the amount of it required to combine withsome standard mass of some standard element. If an elementis %-valent, so that one of its atoms can hold in combinationn atoms of hydrogen, the chemical equivalent of this elementmay be taken to be 1/n of its atomic weight ; and thereforeFaraday's result may be expressed by saying that an electriccurrent will liberate exactly one atom of the elementinquestion in the time which it would take to liberate n atomsof hydrogen.-)-
The quantitative law seemed to Faraday:}: to indicate that" the atoms of matter are in some way endowed or associatedwith electrical powers, to which they owe their most strikingqualities, and amongst them their mutual chemical affinity."Looking at the facts of electrolytic decomposition from thispoint of view, he showed how natural it is to suppose thatthe electricity which passes through the electrolyte is the exactequivalent of that which is possessed by the atoms separatedatthe electrodes ; which implies that there is a certain absolutequantity of the electric power associated with each atomofmatter. The claims of this splendid speculation he advocated withconviction. " The harmony," he wrote,
" which it introducesinto the associated theories of definite proportions and electro-chemical affinity is very great. According to it, the equivalentweights of bodies are simply those quantities of them whichcontain equal quantities of electricity, or have naturally equalelectric powers ; it being the ELECTRICITY which determines theequivalent number, because it determines the combining force.Or, if we adopt the atomic theory or phraseology, then the*Exp. Res., 713-821. t In the modern units, 96580 coulombs of electricity must pass round thecircuit in order to liberate of each ion a number of grams equal to the quotient ofthe atomic weight by the valency.

Faraday. 201atoms of bodies which are equivalent to each other in their ordinary chemical action, have equal quantities of electricity
naturally associated with them. " But," he added,
" I mustconfess I am jealous of the term atom : for though it is veryeasy to talk of atoms, it is very difficult to form a clear idea
of their nature, especially when compound bodies are underconsideration."
These discoveries and ideas tended to confirm Faraday in
preferring, among the rival theories of the voltaic cell, that oneto which all his antecedents and connexions predisposed him.The controversy between the supporters of Volta's contact hypothesis on the one hand, and the chemical hypothesis of Davy and Wollaston on the other, had now been carried onfor a generation without any very decisive result. In Germanyand Italy the contact explanation was generally accepted, underthe influence of Christian Heiririch Pfaff, of Kiel (b. 1773,
d. 1852), and of Ohm, and, among the younger men, of GustavTheodor Fechner (b. 1801, d. 1887), of Leipzig,* and StefanoMarianini (b. 1790, d. 1866), of Modena. Among French writers
De La Eive, of Geneva, was, as we have seen, active in supportof the chemical hypothesis; and this side in the dispute hadalways been favoured by the English philosophers.
There is no doubt that when two different metals are putin contact, a difference of potential is set up between themwithout any apparent chemical action ; but while the contact party regarded this as a direct manifestation of a "contactforce
" distinct in kind from all other known forces of nature,
* Johaim Christian Poggendorff (b. 1796, d. 1877), of Berlin, for long the editor of the Annalen der Physik, leaned originally to the chemical side, but in 1838 became convinced of the truth of the contact theory, which he afterwards actively defended. Moritz Hermann Jacobi (b. 1801, d. 1874), of Dorpat, is also to be
mentioned among its advocates. Faraday's first series of investigations on this subject were made in 1834 : Exp, es., series viii. In 1836 De La Kive followed on the same side with his Eccherches sur la Cause de VElectr. Voltaique. The views of Faraday and De LaRive were criticized by Pfaff, Revision der Lehre vom Galvanistntts, Kiel, 1837, and by Fechner, Ann. d.

the chemical party explained it as a consequence of chemicalaffinity or incipient chemical action between the metals andthe surrounding air or moisture. There is also no doubt thatthe continued activity of a voltaic cell is always accompaniedby chemical unions or decompositions ; but while the chemicalparty asserted that these constitute the efficient source of the-current, the contact party regarded them as secondary actions,and attributed the continual circulation of electricity to theperpetual tendency of the electromotive force of contacttotransfer charge from one substance to another. One of the most active supporters of the chemical theoryamong the English physicists immediately preceding Faradaywas Peter Mark Eoget (b. 1779, d. 1869), to whom are duetwoof the strongest arguments in its favour. In the first place,carefully distinguishing between the quantity of electricity putinto circulation by a cell and the tension at which this electricityis furnished, he showed that the latter quantity depends onthe" energy of the chemical action "* a fact which, when takentogether with Faraday's discovery that the quantity of electricityput into circulation depends on the amount of chemicals con-sumed, places the origin of voltaic activity beyond all question.Koget's principle was afterwards verified by Faradayf andbyDe La EiveJ;
" the electricity of the voltaic pile is proportionatein its intensity to the intensity of the affinities concernedinits production," said the former in 1834; while De La Kivewrote in 1836,
" The intensity of the currents developedincombinations and in decompositions is exactly proportionaltothe degree of affinity which subsists between the atoms whosecombination or separation has given rise to these currents."
* " The absolute quantity of electricity which is thus developed, and madetocirculate, will depend upon a variety of circumstances, such as the extent of thesurfaces in chemical action, the facilities afforded to its transmission, &c. Butits degree of intensity, or tension, as it is often termed, will be regulated by othercauses, and more especially by the energy of the chemical action." Roget'sGalvanism (1832), 70. t Exp.

Faraday. 203Not resting here, however, Koget brought up another argument of far-reaching significance.
"
If," he wrote,*
" there could
exist a power having the property ascribed to it by the [contact]
hypothesis, namely, that of giving continual impulse to a fluid in one constant direction, without being exhausted by its ownaction, it would differ essentially from all the other knownpowers in nature. All the powers and sources of motion, withthe operation of which we are acquainted, when producing their peculiar effects, are expended in the same proportion as those
effects are produced ; and hence arises the impossibility of obtaining by their agency a perpetual effect ; or, in other words, a perpetual motion. But the electro-motive force ascribed byYolta to the metals when in contact is a force which, as long
as a free course is allowed to the electricity it sets in motion,
is never expended, and continues to be exerted with undiminished power, in the production of a never-ceasing effect. Against the truth of such a supposition the probabilities are
all but infinite." This principle, which is little less than the doctrine of conservation of energy applied to a voltaic cell, was reasserted by Faraday. The process imagined by the contact school
" would," he wrote, "indeed be a creation of'power-, like no other
force in nature." In all known cases energy is not generated,
but only transformed. There is no such thing in the world as "a pure creation of force; a production of power without acorresponding exhaustion of something to supply it."f As time went on, each of the rival theories of the cell became modified in the direction of the other. The contact party admitted the importance of the surfaces at which the
metals are in contact with the liquid, where of course the chief chemical action takes place ; and the chemical party confessed
their inability to explain the state of tension which subsists before the circuit is closed, without introducing hypotheses just as uncertain as that of contact force. *Roget's Galvanism (1832), 113.

204 Faraday.
Faraday's own view on this point* was that a plateofamalgamated zinc, when placed in dilute sulphuric acid,
" haspower so far to act, by its attraction for the oxygen of theparticles'in contact with it, as to place the similar forces alreadyactive between these and the other particles of oxygen andthe particles of hydrogen in the water, in a peculiar stateoftension or polarity, and probably also at the same timetothrow those of its own particles which are in contact withthewater into a similar but opposed state. Whilst this stateisretained, no further change occurs: but when it is relievedby completion of the circuit, in which case the forces determinedin opposite directions, with respect to the zinc and the electrolyte, are found exactly competent to neutralize each other, thena series of decompositions and recompositions takes placeamongst the particles of oxygen and hydrogen which constitutethe water, between the place of contact with the platina andthe place where the zinc is active : these intervening particlesbeing evidently in close dependence upon and relation to eachother. The zinc forms a direct compound with those particlesof oxygen which were, previously, in divided relation to bothit and the hydrogen : the oxide is removed by the acid, andafresh surface of zinc is presented to the water, to renewandrepeat the action." These ideas were developed further by the later adherentsof the chemical theory, especially by Faraday's friend ChristianFriedrich Schonbein,f of Basle (6. 1799, d. 1868), the discovererof ozone. Schonbein made the hypothesis more definitebyassuming that when the circuit is open, the molecules of wateradjacent to the zinc plate are electrically polarized, the oxygenside of each molecule being turned towards the zinc and beingnegatively charged, while the hydrogen side is turned awayfrom the zinc and is positively charged. In the third quarter* Exp. &., 949.

Faraday. 205of the nineteenth century, the general opinion was in favour
of some such conception as this. Helmholtz* attempted to- grasp the molecular processes more intimately by assumingthat the different chemical elements have different attractive- powers (exerted only at small distances) for the vitreous andresinous electricities : thus potassium and zinc have strong
attractions for positive charges, while oxygen, chlorine, andbromine have strong attractions for negative electricity. This
differs from Volta's original hypothesis in little else but
in assuming two electric fluids where Volta assumed only
one. It is evident that the contact difference of potential;
between two metals may be at once explained by Helmholtz's,
hypothesis, as it was by Volta's ; and the activity of the voltaic
cell may be referred to the same principles : for the two ions
of which the liquid molecules are composed will also possess
different attractive powers for the electricities, and may be
supposed to be united respectively with vitreous and resinous,
charges. Thus when two metals are immersed in the liquid,^
the circuit being open, the positive ions are attracted to the
negative metal and the negative ions to the positive metal,,
thereby causing a polarized arrangement of the liquid molecules near the metals. When the circuit is closed, the positively
charged surface of the positive metal is dissolved into the fluid;,
and as the atoms carry their charge with them, the positive
charge on the immersed surface of this metal must be per- petually renewed by a current flowing in the outer circuit. It will be seen that Helmholtz did not adhere to Davy'ssdoctrine of the electrical nature of chemical affinity quite as, simply or closely as Faraday, who preferred it in its most direct and uncompromising form. " All the facts show us," he wrote,f
"that that power commonly called chemical affinity can be> communicated to a distance through the metals and certain
forms of carbon ; that the electric current is only another form
of the forces of chemical affinity ; that its power is in proportion.

to the chemical affinities producing it ; that when it is deficientin force it may be helped by calling in chemical aid, the wantin the former being made up by an equivalent of the latter;that, in other words, the forces termed chemical affinity andelectricity are one and the same." In the interval between Faraday's earlier and later paperson the cell, some important results on the same subject werepublished by Frederic Daniell (b. 1790, d. 1845), ProfessorofChemistry in King's College, London.* Daniell showed thatwhen a current is passed through a solution of a salt in water,the ions which carry the current are those derived from the salt,and not the oxygen and hydrogen ions derived from the water;this follows since a current divides itself between different mixedelectrolytes according to the difficulty of decomposing each, andit is known that pure water can be electrolysed only with greatdifficulty. Daniell further showed that the ions arising from(say) sodium sulphate are not represented by Na2 and S03 , butby Na and S04 ; and that in such a case as this, sulphuric acidis formed at the anode and soda at the cathode by secondaryaction, giving rise to the observed evolution of oxygen andhydrogen respectively at these terminals.
The researches of Faraday on the decomposition of chemicalcompounds placed between electrodes maintained at differentpotentials led him in 1837 to reflect on the behaviour of suchsubstances as oil of turpentine or sulphur, when placed in thesame situation. These bodies do not conduct electricity, andare not decomposed ; but if the metallic faces of a condenserare maintained at a definite potential difference, and if thespace between them is occupied by one of these insulatingsubstances, it is found that the charge on either face dependson the nature of the insulating substance. If for any particularinsulator the charge has a value s times the value whichitwould have if the intervening body were air, the numberfmay be regarded as a measure of the influence whichtheinsulator exerts on the propagation of electrostatic action* Phil. Trans., 1839, p. 97.
Faraday. 207through it : it was called by Faraday the specific inductive
capacity of the insulator.* The discovery of this property of insulating substances or
dielectrics raised the question as to whether it could be
harmonized with the old ideas of electrostatic action. Consider,
for example, the force of attraction or repulsion between two
small electrically- charged bodies. So long as they are in air, the force is proportional to the inverse square of the distance ; but if the medium in which they are immersed be partly
changed e.g.,
if a globe of sulphur be inserted in the intervening
space this law is no longer valid : the change in the dielectric
affects the distribution of electric intensity throughout the
entire field. The problem could be satisfactorily solved only by forming a physical conception of the action of dielectrics : and such a
conception Faraday now put forward.
The original idea had been promulgated long before by his master Davy. Davy, it will be remembered,f in his explanation
of the voltaic pile, had supposed that at first, before chemical
decompositions take place, the liquid plays a part analogous to that of the glass in a Leyden jar, and that in this is involved an
electric polarization of the liquid molecules.^ This hypothesis was now developed by Faraday. Keferring first to his own workon electrolysis, he asserted that the behaviour of a dielectric is exactly the same as that of an electrolyte, up to the point at which the electrolyte breaks down under the electric stress ; a
dielectric being, in fact, a body which is capable of sustaining
the stress without suffering decomposition.
" For," he argued,||
"

ice being coated with platina foil on its two surfaces, and these

coatings connected with any continued source of the twoelectrical powers, the ice will charge like a Leyden arrangement,presenting a case of common induction, but no current will pass.If the ice be liquefied, the induction will now fall to a certaindegree, because a current can now pass ; but its passingisdependent upon a peculiar molecular arrangement of the particlesconsistent with the transfer of the elements of the electrolyteinopposite directions . . . As, therefore, in the electrolytic action,induction appeared to bethejfe step,and decomposition the second(the power of separating these steps from each other by givingthe solid or fluid condition to the electrolyte being in our hands);: as the induction was the same in its nature as that throughair,glass, wax, &c., produced by any of the ordinary means ; andasthe whole effect in the electrolyte appeared to be an actionofthe particles thrown into a peculiar or polarized state, I wasglad to suspect that common induction itself was in all casesanaction of contiguous particles, and that electrical action atadistance (i.e., ordinary inductive action) never occurred exceptthrough the influence of the intervening matter."
Thus at the root of Faraday's conception of electrostaticinduction lay this idea that the whole of the insulating mediumthrough which the action takes place is in a state of polarizationsimilar to that which precedes decomposition in an electrolyte." Insulators," he wrote,*
" may be said to be bodies whoseparticles can retain the polarized state, whilst conductors arethose whose particles cannot be permanently polarized."
The conception which he at this time entertained of thepolarization may be reconstructed from what he had alreadywritten concerning electrolytes. He supposedf that in theordinary or unpolarized condition of a body, the molecules consist of atoms which are bound to each other by the forcesofchemical affinity, these forces being really electrical in theirnature ; and that the same forces are exerted, though to a less* Exp.Res., 1338. t This must not be taken to be more than an idea which Faraday mentionedaspresent to his mind. He declined as yet to formulate a definite hypothesis.

thus producing the phenomena of cohesion. When an electric
field is set up, a change takes place in the distribution of these
forces ; some are strengthened and some are weakened, the
effect being symmetrical about the direction of the applied
electric force. Such a polarized condition acquired by a dielectric whenplaced in an electric field presents an evident analogy to the
condition of magnetic polarization which is acquired by a mass
of soft iron when placed in a magnetic field ; and it was therefore natural that in discussing the matter Faraday should
introduce lines of electric force, similar to the lines of magnetic
force which he had employed so successfully in his previous
researches. A line of electric force he defined to be a curve whose tangent at every point has the same direction as the
electric intensity.
The changes which take place in an electric field when the
dielectric is varied may be very simply described in terms of
lines of force. Thus if a mass of sulphur, or other substance of high specific inductive capacity, is introduced into the field, the effect is as if the lines of force tend to crowd into it : as W. Thomson (Kelvin) showed later, they are altered in the same way as the lines of flow of heat, in a case of steady con- duction of heat, would be altered by introducing a body of greater conducting power for heat. By studying the figures of the lines of force in a great number of individual cases, Faraday was led to notice that they always dispose themselves as if they were subject to a mutual repulsion, or as if the tubes of force had an inherent tendency to dilate.* It is interesting to interpret by aid of these conceptions the
law of Priestley and Coulomb regarding the attraction between
two oppositely-charged spheres. In Faraday's view, the mediumintervening between the spheres is the seat of a system of
stresses, which may be represented by an attraction or tension
along the lines of electric force at every point, together with a

mutual repulsion of these lines, or pressure laterally. Wherealine of force ends on one of the spheres, its tension is exercisedon the sphere: in this way, every surface-element of eachsphere is pulled outwards. If the spheres were entirelyremoved from each other's influence, the state of stress wouldbeuniform round each sphere, and the pulls on its surface-elementswould balance, giving no resultant force on the sphere. Butwhen the two spheres are brought into each other's presence,the unit lines of force become somewhat more crowded togetheron the sides of the spheres which face than on the remote sides,and thus the resultant pull on either sphere tends to drawittoward the other. When the spheres are at distances greatcompared with their radii, the attraction is nearly proportionalto the inverse square of the distance, which is Priestley's law.In the following year (1838) Faraday amplified* his theoryof electrostatic induction, by making further use of the analogywith the induction of magnetism. Fourteen years previouslyPoisson had imaginedf an admirable model of the molecularprocesses which accompany magnetization; and this was nowapplied with very little change by Faraday to the case of induction in dielectrics. " The particles of an insulating dielectric,"he suggested,J
" whilst under induction may be compared toaseries of small magnetic needles, or, more correctly still, toaseries of small insulated conductors. If the space roundacharged globe were filled with a mixture of an insulatingdielectric, as oil of turpentine or air, and small globularconductors, as shot, the latter being at a little distance fromeach other so as to be insulated, then these would in theircondition and action exactly resemble what I consider to bethe condition and action of the particles of the insulatingdielectric itself. If the globe were charged, these little con-ductors would all be polar ; if the globe were discharged, theywould all return to their normal state, to be polarized againupon the recharging of the globe/'

Let p

The conception of action propagated step by step throughamedium by the influence of contiguous particles had a firm holdon Faraday's mind, and was applied by him in almost everypart of physics.
" It appears to me possible," he wrotein1838,*
" and even probable, that magnetic action maybecommunicated to a distance by the action of the interveningparticles, in a manner having a relation to the way in whichthe inductive forces of static electricity are transferred toadistance ; the intervening particles assuming for the time moreor less of a peculiar condition, which (though with a veryimperfect idea) I have several times expressed by the termelectro-tonic state."^ The same set of ideas sufficed to explain electric currents.Conduction, Faraday suggested,* might be " an actionofcontiguous particles, dependent on the forces developedinelectrical excitement ; these forces bring the particles intoastate of tension or polarity ; and being in this state thecontiguous particles have a power or capability of communicatingthese forces, one to the other, by which they are loweredanddischarge occurs."

Faraday. 213
After working strenuously for the ten years which followed
the discovery of induced currents, Faraday found in 1841 that
his health was affected ; and for four years he rested. A second
period of brilliant discoveries began in 1845.
Many experiments had been made at different times by
various investigators* with the purpose of discovering a connexion between magnetism and light. These had generally
taken the form of attempts to magnetize bodies by exposure
in particular ways to particular kinds of radiation ; and a
successful issue had been more than once reported, only to be
negatived on re-examination.
The true path was first indicated by Sir John Herschel.
After his discovery of the connexion between the outward form
of quartz crystals and their property of rotating the plane of polarization of light, Herschel remarked that a rectilinear
electric current, deflecting a needle to right and left all round
it, possesses a helicoidal dissymmetry similar to that displayed
by the crystals.
" Therefore," he wrote,f
" induction led me to conclude that a similar connexion exists, and must turn upsomehow or other, between the electric current and polarized
light, and that the plane of polarization would be deflected bymagneto-electricity."
The nature of this connexion was discovered by Faraday,
who so far back as 1834J had transmitted polarized light
through an electrolytic solution during the passage of the
current, in the hope of observing a change of polarization.
This early attempt failed ; but in September, 1845, he varied
the experiment by placing a piece of heavy glass between the
poles of an excited electro-magnet ; and found that the plane
of polarization of a beam of light was rotated when the beamtravelled through the glass parallel to the lines of force of the
magnetic field. *e.g. by Morichini, of Rome, in 1813, Quart. Journ. Sci. xix, p. 338; by
Samuel Hunter Christie, of Cambridge, in 1825, Phil. Trans., 1826, p. 219 ; and by Mary Somerville in the same year, Phil. Trans., 1826, p. 132. t Sir. J. Herschel in Bence Jones's Life of Faraday, p. 205. lExp. Res., 951. \Ib., 2152.

In the year following Faraday's discovery, Airy* suggesteda way of representing the effect analytically; as might have beenexpected, this was by modifying the equations which had beenalready introduced by MacCullagh for the case of naturallyactive bodies. In Mac Cullagh's equations

Airy proposed the equations

The former pair arise, as will appear later, in Maxwell'stheory of rotatory polarization : the latter pair, which weresuggested in 1868 by Boussinesq,f follow from that physicaltheory of the phenomenon which is generally accepted at thepresent time.*
Airy's work on the magnetic rotation of light was limitedin the same way as MacCullagh's work on the rotatory powerof quartz ; it furnished only an analytical representation of theeffect, without attempting to justify the equations. The earliest endeavour to provide a physical theory seems to have beenmade in 1858, in the inaugural dissertation of Carl Neumann,* Comptes Rendus, Ivi (1863), p. 630. t Journal de Math., xiii (1868), p. 430.

of Halle.* Neumann assumed that every element of an electriccurrent exerts force on the particles of the aether ; and in parti-cular that this is true of the molecular currents which constitutemagnetization, although in this case the force vanishes exceptwhen the aethereal particle is already in motion. If e denote thedisplacement of the aethereal particle ra, the force in questionmay be represented by the term
km [ e. K]
where K denotes the imposed magnetic field, and k denotesamagneto-optic constant characteristic of the body. Whenthisterm is introduced into the equations of motion of the aether,they take the form which had been suggested by Airy ; whenceNeumann's hypothesis is seen to lead to the incorrect conclusionthat the rotation is independent of the wave-length.
The rotation of plane-polarized light depends, as Fresnel hadshown,f on a difference between the velocities of propagationofthe right-handed and left-handed circularly polarized waves intowhich plane-polarized light may be resolved. In the case ofmagnetic rotation, this difference was shown by Verdet to beproportional to the component of the magnetic force in thedirection of propagation of the light; and CornuJ showed furtherthat the mean of the velocities of the right-handed and left-handed waves is equal to the velocity of light in the mediumwhen there is no magnetic field. From these data, by Fresnel'sgeometrical method, the wave-surface in the medium maybeobtained; it is found to consist of two spheres (one relatingto the right-handed and one to the left-handed light), eachidentical with the spherical wave-surface of the unmagnetizedmedium, displaced from each other along the lines of magneticforce.The discovery of the connexion between magnetism and*

Faraday. 217light gave interest to a short paper of a speculative character
which Faraday published* in 1846, under the title " Thoughtson Kay-Vibrations." In this it is possible to trace the progress
of Faraday's thought towards something like an electro-magnetic
theory of light.
Considering first the nature of ponderable matter, he suggests
that an ultimate atom may be nothing else than a field of force electric, magnetic, and gravitational surrounding a point- centre ; on this view, which is substantially that of Michell andBoscovich, an atom would have no definite size, but oughtrather to be conceived of as completely penetrable, and extending throughout all space ; and the molecule of a chemicalcompound would consist not of atoms side by side, but of
" spheres of power mutually penetrated, and the centres evencoinciding."t
All space being thus permeated by lines of force, Faradaysuggested that light and radiant heat might be transverse
vibrations propagated along these lines of force. In this wayhe proposed to " dismiss the aether," or rather to replace it bylines of force between centres, the centres together with their
lines of force constituting the particles of material substances.
If the existence of a luminiferous aether were to be admitted,
Faraday suggested that it might be the vehicle of magneticforce ; "
for," he wrote in 1851,{ "it is not at all unlikely that
if there be an aether, it should have other uses than simplythe conveyance of radiations." This sentence may be regardedas the origin of the electro-magnetic theory of light.
At the time when the " Thoughts on Eay-Vibrations " werepublished, Faraday was evidently trying to comprehend everything in terms of lines of force ; his confidence in which hadbeen recently justified by another discovery. A few weeksafter the first observation of the magnetic rotation of light, henoticed that a bar of the heavy glass which had been used in * Phil. Mag. (3), xxviii (1846) : Exp. Res., iii, p. 447. t Cf. Bence Jones's Life of Faraday, ii, p. 178. J Exp. Res., $ 3075. Phil. Trans., 1846, p. 21 : Exp. Res., 2253.
218 Faraday.
this investigation, when suspended between the poles of anelectro-magnet, set itself across the line joining the poles : thusbehaving in the contrary way to a bar of an ordinary magneticsubstance, which would tend to set itself along this line. Asimpler manifestation of the effect was obtained when a cubeor sphere of the substance was used ; in such forms it showeda disposition to move from the stronger to the weaker placesof the magnetic field. The pointing of the bar was then seento be merely the resultant of the tendencies of each of itsparticles to move outwards into the positions of weakestmagnetic action. Many other bodies besides heavy glass were foundtodisplay the same property ; in particular, bismuth.* The namediamagnetic was given to them.
" Theoretically," remarked Faraday,
" an explanation of themovements of the diamagnetic bodies might be offered in thesupposition that magnetic induction caused in them a contrarystate to that which it produced in magnetic matter ; i.e. thatifa particle of each kind of matter were placed in the magneticfield, both would become magnetic, and each would haveitsaxis parallel to the resultant of magnetic force passing throughit ; but the particle of magnetic matter would have its northand south poles opposite, or facing toward the contrary polesof the inducing magnet, whereas with the diamagnetic particlesthe reverse would be the case ; and hence would result approximation in the one substance, recession in the other. UponAmpere's theory, this view would be equivalent to the supposition that, as currents are induced in iron and magneticsparallel to those existing in the inducing magnet or batterywire, so in bismuth, heavy glass, and diamagnetic bodies, thecurrents induced are in the contrary direction." This explanation became generally known as the " hypothesisof diamagnetic polarity
"
; it represents diamagnetism as similar* The repulsion of bismuth in the magnetic field had been previously observedby A. Brugmans in 1778; Antonii Brugmans Magnetismus, Lugd. Bat., 1778.

Faraday. 219to ordinary induced magnetism in all respects, except that thedirection of the induced polarity is reversed. It was acceptedby other investigators, notably by W. Weber, Pliicker, Eeich,and Tyndall ; but was afterwards displaced from the favour of
its inventor by another conception, more agreeable to his peculiarviews on the nature of the magnetic field. In this secondhypothesis, Faraday supposed an ordinary magnetic or paramagnetic* body to be one which offers a specially easy passageto lines of magnetic force, so that they tend to crowd intoit in preference to other bodies ; while he supposed a dia- magnetic body to have a low degree of conducting power for the lines of force, so that they tend to avoid it. "
If, then," hereasoned,f "a medium having a certain conducting power occupythe magnetic field, and then a portion of another medium orsubstance be placed in the field having a greater conductingpower, the latter will tend to draw up towards the place of greatest force, displacing the former." There is an electrostatic
effect to which this is quite analogous ; a charged body attracts a body whose specific inductive capacity is greater than that of the surrounding medium, and repels a body whose specific
inductive capacity is less; in either case the tendency is to
afford the path of best conductance to the lines of force.J For some time the advocates of the "polarity" and" conduction " theories of diarnagnetism carried on a contro-versy which, indeed, like the controversy between the adherentsof the one-fluid and two-fluid theories of electricity, persisted
after it had been shown that the rival hypotheses were mathematically equivalent, and that no experiment could be suggestedwhich would distinguish between them.
Meanwhile new properties of magnetizable bodies were beingdiscovered. In 1847 Julius Pliicker (b. 1801, d. 1868), Professorof Natural Philosophy in the University of Bonn, whilerepeating and extending Faraday's magnetic experiments,* This term was introduced by Faraday, Exp. Res., 2790. t Exp. es., 2798.

observed* that certain uniaxal crystals, when placed betweenthe two poles of a magnet, tend to set themselves so that theoptic axis has the equatorial position. At this time Faradaywas continuing his researches ; and, while investigating thediamagnetic properties of bismuth, was frequently embarrassedby the occurrence of anomalous results. In 1848 he ascertainedthat these were in some way connected with the crystallineform of the substance, and showedf that when a crystal ofbismuth is placed in a field of uniform magnetic force (so thatno tendency to motion arises from its diamagnetism) it setsitself so as to have one of its crystalline axes directed alongthe lines of force. At first he supposed this effect to be distinct from thatwhich had been discovered shortly before by Pliicker. " Theresults," he wrote,J
" are altogether very different from thoseproduced by diamagnetic action. They are equally distinct fromthose discovered and described by Pliicker, in his beautifulresearches into the relation of the optic axis to magnetic action; for there the force is equatorial, whereas here it is axial. Sothey appear to present to us a new force, or a new formofforce, in the molecules of matter, which, for convenience sake,I will conventionally designate by a new word, as the magnecrystallic force." Later in the same year, however, he recognized^that " the phaenomena discovered by Pliicker and those of whichI have given an account have one common origin and cause." The idea of the " conduction " of lines of magnetic force bydifferent substances, by which Faraday had so successfullyexplained the phenomena of diamagnetism, he now appliedtothe study of the magnetic behaviour of crystals.
"
If," he wrote,||"the idea of conduction be applied to these magnecrystallicbodies, it would seem to satisfy all that requires explanationintheir special results. A magnecrystallic substance would thenbe one which in the crystallized state could conduct onwards,or* Ann. d. Phys. Ixxii (1847), p. 315; Taylor's Scientific Memoirs, v, p. 353. t Phil.

Faraday. 221permit the exertion of the magnetic force with more facility inone direction than another ; and that direction would be themagnecrystallic axis. Hence, when in the magnetic field, themagnecrystallic axis would be urged into a position coincidentwith the magnetic axis, by a force correspondent to thatdifference, just as if two different bodies were taken, when theone with the greater conducting power displaces that which is weaker."
This hypothesis led Faraday to predict the existence ofanother type of magnecrystallic effect, as yet unobserved. " Ifsuch a view were correct/' he wrote,*
"
it would appear tofollow that a diamagnetic body like bismuth ought to be lessdiamagnetic when its magnecrystallic axis is parallel to themagnetic axis than when it is perpendicular to it. In the twopositions it should be equivalent to two substances havingdifferent conducting powers for magnetism, and therefore if submitted to the differential balance ought to presentdifferential phaenomena." This expectation was realized whenthe matter was subjected to the test of experiment.f
The series of Faraday's
" Experimental Researches inElectricity
" end in the year 1855. The closing period of hislife was quietly spent at Hampton Court, in a house placed athis disposal by the kindness of the Queen ; and here on August25th, 1867, he passed away.
Among experimental philosophers Faraday holds by universal consent the foremost place. The memoirs in which hisdiscoveries are enshrined will never cease to be read withadmiration and delight; and future generations will preservewith an affection not less enduring the personal records andfamiliar letters, which recall the memory of his humble andunselfish spirit.

THE MATHEMATICAL ELECTRICIANS OF THE MIDDLE OF THENINETEENTH CENTURY.
WHILE Faraday was engaged in discovering the laws of inducedcurrents in his own way, by use of the conception of linesofforce, his contemporary Franz Neumann was attacking thesame problem from a different point of view. Xeumannpreferred to take Ampere as his model ; and in 1845 publisheda memoir,* in which the laws of induction of currents werededuced by the help of Ampere's analysis.
Among the assumptions on which Neumann based his workwas a rule which had been formulated, not long after Faraday'soriginal discovery, by Emil Lenz,f and which may be enunciatedas follows : when a conducting circuit is moved in a magneticfield, the induced current flows in such a direction that theponderomotive forces on it tend to oppose the motion.
Let ds denote an element of the circuit which is in motion,and let C ds denote the component, taken in the directionofmotion, of the ponderomotive force exerted by the inducingcurrent on d$, when the latter is carrying unit current ; so thatthe value of C is known from Ampere's theory. Then Lenz'srule requires that the product of C into the strength of theinduced current should be negative. Xeumann assumed thatthis is because it consists of a negative coefficient multiplyingthe square of C\ that is, he assumed the induced electro-motive force to be proportional to C. He further assumed it tobe proportional to the velocity v of the motion; and thusobtained for the electromotive force induced in ds the expression- ei-Cds,
where e denotes a constant coefficient. By aid of this formula,Berlin Abhandlungen, 1845, p. 1 ; 1848, p. 1 ; reprinted as Xo. 10 andNo. 36 of Ostwald's Klassiker-, translated Journal de Math, xiii (1848), p. 113.t Ann. d. Phys. xxxi (1834), p. 483.
Middle of the Nineteenth Century. 223in the earlier part* of the memoir, he calculated the induced
currents in various particular cases. But having arrived at the formulae in this way, Neumannnoticedf a peculiarity in them which suggested a totally
different method of treating the subject. In fact, on examining
the expression for the current induced in a circuit which is in motion in the field due to a magnet, it appeared that this induced current depends only on the alteration caused by the
motion in the value of a certain function ; and, moreover, that
this function is no other than the potential of the ponderomotive
forces which, according to Ampere's theory, act between the
circuit, supposed traversed by unit current, and the magnet.
Accordingly, Neumann now proposed to reconstruct his theory by taking this potential function as the foundation.
The nature of Neumann's potential, and its connexion
with Faraday's theory, will be understood from the following
considerations : The potential energy of a magnetic molecule M in a field of magnetic intensity B is (B . M) ; and therefore the potential
energy of a current i flowing in a circuit s in this field is
where S denotes a diaphragm bounded by the circuit s ; as is seen at once on replacing the circuit by its equivalent magnetic
shell S. If the field B be produced by a current i' flowing in a
circuit s', we have, by the formula of Biot and Savart,

Hence, the mutual potential energy of the two currents is - . dS
which hy Stokes's transformation may be written in the form(ds.ds')
This expression represents the amount of mechanical workwhich must be performed against the electro-dynamic ponderomotive forces, in order to separate the two circuits to an infinitedistance apart, when the current-strengths are maintainedunaltered. The above potential function has been obtained byconsidering the ponderomotive forces ; but it can now be connectedwith Faraday's theory of induction of currents. Forbyinterpreting the expression
(B . dS)
If' in terms of lines of force, we see that the potential functionrepresents the product of i into the number of unit-linesofmagnetic force due to s't which pass through the gap formedbythe circuit s ; and since by Faraday's law the currents inducedin s depend entirely on the variation in the number of theselines, it is evident that the potential function supplies all thatis needed for the analytical treatment of the induced currents.This was Neumann's discovery.
The electromotive force induced in a circuit s by the motionof other circuits s', carrying currents i't is thus proportionaltothe time-rate of variation of the potential
(ds.ds').
so that if we denote by a the vector

from which r is measured, then the electromotive force inducedin any circuit-element ds by any alteration in the currentswhich give rise to a is (a. ds). The induction of currents is therefore governed by the vector a ; this, which is generally known as the vector-potential, has fromNeumann's time onwards played a great part in electrical theory.
It may be readily interpreted in terms of Faraday's conceptions ; for (a . ds) represents the total number of unit lines of magneticforce which have passed across the line-element ds prior to theinstant t. The vector-potential may in fact be regarded as theanalytical measure of Faraday's electrotonic state* While Neumann was endeavouring to comprehend the lawsof induced currents in an extended form of Ampere's theory,
another investigator was attempting a still more ambitiousproject : no less than that of uniting electrodynamics into acoherent whole with electrostatics. Wilhelm Weber (6. 1804, d. 1890) was in the earlier part of his scientific career a friend and colleague of Gauss at Gottingen.
In 1837, however, he became involved in political trouble. Theunion of Hanover with the British Empire, which had subsisted
since the accession of the Hanoverian dynasty to the British
throne, was in that year dissolved by the operation of the Salic law ; the Princess Victoria succeeded to the crown of England,and her uncle Ernest-Augustus to that of Hanover. The newking, who was a pronounced reactionary, revoked the free constitution which the Hanoverians had for some time enjoyed ; and Weber, who took a prominent part in opposing this action, was deprived of his professorship. From 1843 to 1849, whenhis principal theoretical researches in electricity were made,
he occupied a chair in the University of Leipzig.
The theory of Weber was in its origin closely connected
with the work of another Leipzig professor, Fechner, who in 1845f introduced certain assumptions regarding the nature of
* Cf. pp. 212, 272. t Ann. d. Phys. Lxiv (1845), p. 337. Q
226 The Mathematical Electricians of the
electric currents. Fechner supposed every current to consistina streaming of electric charges, the vitreous charges travellingin one direction, and the resinous charges, equal to theminmagnitude and number, travelling in the opposite direction withequal velocity. He further supposed that like charges attracteach other when they are moving parallel to the same direction,while unlike charges attract when they are moving in oppositedirections. On these assumptions he succeeded in bringingFaraday's induction effects into connexion with Ampere'slawsof electrodynamics.
In 1846 Weber,* adopting the same assumptions as Fechner,analysed the phenomena in the following way : The formula of Ampere for the ponderomotive force betweentwo elements ds, ds' of currents it i', may be written
r ds ds r
2 ds ds' Suppose now that X units of vitreous electricity are containedin unit length of the wire s, and are moving with velocityu;and that an equal quantity of resinous electricity is movingwith velocity u in the opposite direction ; so that

This expression for the force between two electric chargeswas taken by Weber as the basis of his theory. Weber's is thefirst of the electron-theories a name given to any theory whichattributes the phenomena of electrodynamics to the agencyof moving electric charges, the forces on which dependnotonly on the position of the charges (as in electrostatics), butalso on their velocity.
The latter feature of Weber's theory led its earliest criticsto deny that his law of force could be reconciled withtheprinciple of conservation of energy. They were, however,mistaken on this point, as may be seen from the followingconsiderations. The above expression for the force betweentwo charges may be written in the form

of ; but another and more serious one now presents itself. Theoccurrence of the negative sign with the term -
ee'r^/Zr implies
that a charge behaves somewhat as if its mass were negative, so that in certain circumstances its velocity might increase indefi- nitely under the action of a force opposed to the motion. Thisis one of the vulnerable points of Weber's theory, and has beenthe object of much criticism. In fact,* suppose that one chargedparticle of mass /z. is free to move, and that the other charges
are spread uniformly over the surface of a hollow spherical
insulator in which the particle is enclosed. The equation of conservation of energy is ^(fi-ep)v*+ V= constant,

Leaving this objection unanswered, we proceed to show howWeber's law of force between electrons leads to the formulae

By reasoning similar to Neumann's, it may be shown that theelectromotive force induced in ds by any alteration in the restof the field is -(ds.a);
and thus a complete theory of induced currents maybeconstructed.
The necessity for induced currents may be inferred bygeneral reasoning from the first principles of Weber's theory.When a circuit s moves in the field due to currents, the velocityof the vitreous charges in s is, owing to the motion of s, notequal and opposite to that of the resinous charges : this givesrise to a difference in the forces acting on the vitreous andresinous charges in s ; and hence the charges of opposite signseparate from each other and move in opposite directions. The assumption that positive and negative charges movewith equal and opposite velocities relative to the matterof
Middle of the Nineteenth Century. 231the conductor is one to which, for various reasons which will appear later, objection may be taken ; but it is an integral partof Weber's theory, and cannot be excised from it. In fact,
if this condition were not satisfied, and if the law of force wereWeber's, electric currents would exert forces on electrostatic charges at rest*; as may be seen by the following example.Let a current flow in a closed circuit formed by arcs of twoconcentric circles and the portions of the radii connecting their extremities; then, if Weber's law were true, and if only onekind of electricity were in motion, the current would evidentlyexert an electrostatic force on a charge placed at the centre ofthe circles. It has been shown,f indeed, that the assumptionof opposite electricities moving with equal and opposite velocities in a circuit is almost inevitable in any theory of the typeof Weber's, so long as the mutual action of two charges is assumed to depend only on their relative (as opposed to theirabsolute) motion.
The law of Weber is not the only one of its kind; an alternative to it was suggested by Bernhard Eiemann (b. 1826, d. 1866),in a course of lectures which were delivered^ at Gottingenin 1861, and which were published after his death byK. Hattendorff. Kiemann proposed as the electrokineticenergy of two electrons e (x, y, z) and e\x

Eventually, as will be seen later, the laws* This remark was first made by Clausius, Journal fur Math. Ixxxii (1877),

Another alternative to Weber's law had been discovered by Gauss so far back as 1835, but was not published until after his death: cf. Gauss' Werke, v, p. 616.
232 The Mathematical Electricians of the
of Riemann and Weber were both abandoned in favour ofathird alternative. At the time, however, Weber's discovery was felt to beagreat advance ; and indeed it had, perhaps, the greatest sharein awakening mathematical physicists to a sense of the possibilities latent in the theory of electricity. Beyond this, itsinfluence was felt in general dynamics ; for Weber's electro-kinetic energy, which resembled kinetic energy in some respectsand potential energy in others, could not be precisely classifiedunder either head ; and its introduction, by helping to breakdown the distinction which had hitherto subsisted betweenthetwo parts of the kinetic potential, prepared the way for themodern transformation-theory of dynamics.*
Another subject whose development was stimulated bythework of Weber was the theory of gravitation. That gravitationis propagated by the action of a medium, and consequently is aprocess requiring time for its accomplishment, had been an articleof faith with many generations of physicists. Indeed, thedependence of the force on the distance between the attractingbodies seemed to suggest this idea ; for a propagation whichistruly instantaneous would, perhaps, be more naturally conceivedto be effected by some kind of rigid connexion between thebodies, which would be more likely to give a force independentof the mutual distance.
It is obvious that, if the simple law of Newton is abandoned,there is a wide field of rival hypotheses from which to chooseits successor. The first notable attempt to discuss the questionwas made by Laplace. f Laplace supposed gravity to be produced by the impulsion on the attracted body of a
" gravificfluid," which flows with a definite velocity toward the centreof attraction say, the sun. If the attracted body or planetis in motion, the velocity of the fluid relative to it will becompounded of the absolute velocity of the fluid and thereversed velocity of the planet, and the force of gravity will* Cf. "Whittaker, Analytical Dynamics, chapters ii, iii, xi. t Meeanique Celeste, Livre x, chap, vii, 22.
Middle of the Nineteenth Century. 233act in the direction thus determined, its magnitude being
unaltered by the planet's motion. This amounts to supposing
that gravity is subject to an aberrational effect similar to that
observed in the case of light. It is easily seen that the modification thus introduced into Newton's law may be represented
by an additional perturbing force, directed along the tangentto the orbit in the opposite sense to the motion, and proportional to the planet's velocity and to the inverse square of the distance from the sun. By considering the influence of
this force on the secular equation of the moon's motion, Laplacefound that the velocity of the gravific fluid must be at least a hundred million times greater than that of light.
The assumptions made by Laplace are evidently in the
highest degree questionable; but the generation immediatelysucceeding, overawed by his fame, seems to have found no wayof improving on them. Under the influence of Weber's ideas,
however, astronomers began to think of modifying Newton'slaw by^ adding a term involving the velocities of the bodies. Tisserand* in 1872 discussed the motion of the planets roundthe sun on the supposition that the law of gravitation is the same as Weber's law of electrodynamic action, so that the
force is

Tisserand showed that theperturbations of all the elements are zero or periodic, and quiteinsensible, except that of the longitude of perihelion, whichhasa secular part. If A be assumed equal to the velocity of light,the effect would be to rotate the major axis of the orbitofMercury in the direct sense 14" in a century.
Now, as it happened, a discordance between theory andobservation was known to exist in regard to the motionofMercury's perihelion ; for Le Verrier had found that the attrac-tion of the planets might be expected to turn the perihelion527" in the direct sense in a century, whereas the motionactually observed was greater than this by 38". It is evident,however, that only f of the excess is explained by Tisserand'sadoption of "Weber's law; and it seemed therefore that thissuggestion would prove as unprofitable as Le Terrier's ownhypothesis of an intra-mercurial planet. But it was foundlater* that f of the excess could be explained by substitutingEiemann's electrodynamic law for Weber's, and that a combination of the laws of Biemann and Weber would give exactlythe amount desired.f After the publication of his memoir on the law of forcebetween electrons, Weber turned his attention to the questionof diamagnetism, and developed Faraday's idea regardingtheexplanation of diamagnetic phenomena by the effects of electriccurrents induced in the diamagnetic bodies.^ Weber remarkedthat if, with Ampere, we assume the existence of molecularcircuits in which there is no ohmic resistance, so that currentscan flow without dissipation of energy, it is quite naturaltosuppose that currents would be induced in these molecular* By Maurice Levy, Comptes Eendus, ex (1890), p. 545. t The consequences of adopting the electrodynamic law of Clausius (for whichsee later) were discussed by Oppenheim, Zur Frage nach der FortpflanzungsgeschwindigJceit der Gravitation, Wien, 1895.

Middle ofthe Nineteenth Century. 235circuits if they were situated in a varying magnetic field ; andhe pointed out that such induced molecular currents wouldconfer upon the substance the properties characteristic of
dia magnetism.
The difficulty with this hypothesis is to avoid explaining too much ; for, if it be accepted, the inference seems to be that all bodies, without exception, should be diamagnetic. Weber escaped
from this conclusion by supposing that in iron and other
magnetic substances there exist permanent molecular currents,
which do not owe their origin to induction, and which, underthe influence of the impressed magnetic force, set themselves in
definite orientations. Since a magnetic field tends to give such
a direction to a pre-existing current that its course becomesopposed to that of the current which would be induced by the
increase of the magnetic force, it follows that a substance stored
with such pre-existing currents would display the phenomenaof paramagnetism: t The bodies ordinarily called paramagnetic
are, according to this hypothesis, those bodies in which the
paramagnetism is strong enough to mask the diamagnetism.
The radical distinction which Weber postulated between the
natures of paramagnetism and diamagnetism accords with manyfacts which have been discovered subsequently. Thus in 1895
P. Curie showed* that the magnetic susceptibility per grammemolecule is connected with the temperature by laws which are
different for paramagnetic and diamagnetic bodies. For the
former it varies in inverse proportion to the absolute temperature, whereas for diamagnetic bodies it is independent of the
temperature.
The conclusions which followed from the work of Faraday
and Weber were adverse to the hypothesis of magnetic fluids ; for according to that hypothesis the induced polarity would be
in the same direction whether due to a change of orientation of pre-existing molecular magnets, or to a fresh separation of magnetic fluids in the molecules. " Through the discovery of

diamagnetism," wrote Weber* in 1852, "the hypothesisofelectric molecular currents in the interior of bodies is cor-roborated, and the hypothesis of magnetic fluids in the interiorof bodies is refuted." The latter hypothesis is, moreover, unableto account for the phenomena shown by bodies whicharestrongly magnetic, like iron : for it is found that whenthemagnetizing force is gradually increased to a very large value,the magnetization induced in such bodies does not increaseinproportion, but tends to a saturation value This effect cannotbe explained on the assumptions of Poisson,but is easily deduciblefrom those of Weber; for, according to Weber's theory, themagnetizing force merely orients existing magnets ; and whenithas attained such a value that all of them are oriented in thesame direction, there is nothing further to be done,
Weber's theory in its original form is, however, opentosome objection. If the elementary magnets are supposed tobefree to orient themselves without encountering any resistance,it is evident that a very small magnetizing force would sufficeto turn them all parallel to each other, and thus would produceimmediately the greatest possible intensity of induced magnetism.To overcome this difficulty, Weber assumed that every displacement of a molecular circuit is resisted by a couple, which tendsto restore the circuit to its original orientation. This assumption fails, however, to account for the fact that iron whichhas been placed in a strong magnetic field does not returnto its original condition when it is removed from the field,but retains a certain amount of residual magnetization.
Another alternative was to assume a frictional resistanceto the rotation of the magnetic molecules ; but if sucharesistance existed, it could be overcome only by a finitemagnetizing force ; and this inference is inconsistent with theobservation that some degree of magnetization is inducedbyevery force, however feeble. The hypothesis which has ultimately gained acceptanceisthat the orientation is resisted by couples which arise from the* Ann. d. Phys. lxxxvii(1852), p. 145 ; Tyndall and Francis' Sci. Mem., p. 163.
Middle of the Nineteenth Century. 237mutual action of the molecular magnets themselves. In theunmagnetized condition the molecules " arrange themselves soas to satisfy their mutual attraction by the shortest path, andthus form a complete closed circuit of attraction," as D. E.Hughes wrote* in 1883 ; when an external magnetizing forceis applied, these small circuits are broken up ; and at any stageof the process a molecular magnet is in equilibrium under thejoint influence of the external force and the forces due to theother molecules.
This hypothesis was suggested by Maxwell,t and has beensince developed by J. A. Ewing;J its consequences may beillustrated by the following simple example : Consider two magnetic molecules, each of magnetic momentm, whose centres are fixed at a distance c apart. Whenundisturbed, they dispose themselves in the position of stableequilibrium, in which they point in the same direction alongthe line c. Now let an increasing magnetic force H be madeto act on them in a direction at right angles to the line c. The magnets turn towards the direction of H ; and whenH attains the value Sm/c3
, they become perpendicular to theline c, after which they remain in this position, when His increased further. Thus they display the phenomena of induction initially proportional to the magnetizing force, and ofsaturation. If the magnetizing force H be supposed to actparallel to the line c, in the direction in which the axesoriginally pointed, the magnets will remain at rest. But if Hacts in the opposite direction, the equilibrium will be stable only so long as H is less than ra/c
3
; when H increases
beyond this limit, the equilibrium becomes unstable, and themagnets turn over so as to point in the direction of H\ whenH is gradually decreased to zero, they remain in their new positions, thus illustrating the phenomenon of residual magnetism.*

By taking a large number of such pairs of magnetic molecules,originally oriented in all directions, and at such distances thatthe pairs do not sensibly influence each other, we mayconstruct a model whose behaviour under the influenceofan external magnetic field will closely resemble the actualbehaviour of ferromagnetic bodies. In order that the magnets in the model may come to restin their new positions after reversal, it will be necessarytosuppose that they experience some kind of dissipative forcewhich damps the oscillations ; to this would correspondinactual magnetic substances the electric currents which wouldbe set up in the neighbouring mass when the molecularmagnets are suddenly reversed ; in either case, the suddenreversals are attended by a transformation of magnetic energyinto heat. The transformation of energy from one form to anotherisasubject which was first treated in a general fashion shortlybefore the middle of the nineteenth century. It had long beenknown that the energy of motion and the energy of positionof a dynamical system are convertible into each other, andthat the amount of their sum remains invariable whenthesystem is self-contained. This principle of conservationofdynamical energy had been extended to optics by Fresnel, whohad assumed* that the energy brought to an interface byincident light is equal to the energy carried away fromtheinterface by the reflected and refracted beams. A similarconception was involved in Eoget's and Faraday's defencefofthe chemical theory of the voltaic cell ; they argued that thework done by the current in the outer circuit must be providedat the expense of the chemical energy stored in the cell, andshowed that the quantity of electricity sent round the circuitis proportional to the quantity of chemicals consumed, whileits tension is proportional to the strength of the chemicalaffinities concerned in the reaction. This theory was extended*Cf. p. 133. tCf. p. 203.
Middle of the Nineteenth Century. 239and completed by James Prescott Joule, of Manchester, in 1841.
Joule, who believed* that heat is producible from mechanical
work and convertible into it, measuredf the amount of heat
evolved in unit time in a metallic wire, through which a
current of known strength was passed; he found the amountto be proportional to the resistance of the wire multiplied bythe square of the current- strength ; or (as follows from Ohm'slaw) to the current-strength multiplied by the difference of
electric tensions at the extremities of the wire. The quantity of energy yielded up as heat in the outer
circuit being thus known, it became possible to consider the
transference of energy in the circuit as a whole. " When,"wrote Joule,
" any voltaic arrangement, whether simple or compound, passes a current of electricity through any substance,
whether an electrolyte or not, the total voltaic heat which is generated in any time is proportional to the number of atomswhich are electrolyzed in each cell of the circuit, multiplied
by the virtual intensity of the battery : if a decomposing cell be in the circuit, the virtual intensity of the battery is reduced
in proportion to its resistance to electrolyzation." In the sameyear hej enhanced the significance of this by showing that the
quantities of heat which are evolved by the combustion of the
equivalents of bodies are proportional to the intensities of their
affinities for oxygen, as measured by the electromotive force of a battery required to decompose the oxide electrolytically.
The theory of Koget and Faraday, thus perfected by Joule,
enables us to trace quantitatively the transformations of energy
in the voltaic cell and circuit. The primary source of energy
is the chemical reaction : in a Daniell cell, ZnjZn SOJCu S04 |Cu, for instance, it is the substitution of zinc for copper as the
partner of the sulphion. The strength of the chemical affinities concerned is in this case measured by the difference of the heats
of formation of zinc sulphate and copper sulphate ; and it is *Cf. p. 33. t Phil. Mag. xix (1841), p. 260 ; Joule's Scientific Papers i, p. 60. I Phil. Mag. xx (1841), p. 98 : cf. also Phil. Mag. xxii (1843), p. 204.

this which determines the electromotive force of the cell.*The amount of energy which is changed from the chemicaltothe electrical form in a given interval of time is measuredbythe product of the strength of the chemical affinity into thequantity of chemicals decomposed in that time, or (what is thesame thing) by the product of the electromotive force of thecell into the quantity of electricity which is circulated. Thisenergy may be either dissipated as heat in conformitytoJoule's law, or otherwise utilized in the outer circuit. The importance of these principles was emphasizedbyHermann von Helmholtz (b. 1821, d. 1894), in a memoir whichwas published in 1847, and which will be more fully noticedpresently, and by W. Thomson (Lord Kelvin) in 1851f;theequations have subsequently received only one importantmodification, which is due to Helmholtz.:}: Helmholtz pointedout that the electrical energy furnished by a voltaic cell neednot be derived exclusively from the energy of the chemicalreactions : for the cell may also operate by abstracting heatenergy from neighbouring bodies, and converting this intoelectrical energy. The extent to which this takes placeisdetermined by a law which was discovered in 1855 by Thomson.Thomson showed that if E denotes the " available energy," i.e.,possible output of mechanical work, of a system maintainedat the absolute temperature T, then a fraction TdE

Now in the case of the voltaic cell, the principle of Eoget, Faraday, and Joule is expressed by the equation ^ = A, where E denotes the available or electrical energy, which is measured by the electromotive force of the cell, and where Xdenotes the heat of the chemical reaction which supplies this energy. In accordance with Thomson's principle, we mustreplace this equation by

enthusiasm, the prejudices of the older generation prevented
its acceptance for the Annalen der Physik ; and it was eventually
published as a separate treatise.f In this memoir it was asserted* that the conservation of

energy is a universal principle of nature : that the kinetic andpotential energy of dynamical systems may be converted intoheat according to definite quantitative laws, as taught byKumford, Joule, and Eobert Mayer* ; and that any of theseforms of energy may be converted into the chemical, electrostatic, voltaic, and magnetic forms. The latter Helmholtzexamined systematically.
Consider first the energy of an electrostatic field. It willbe convenient to suppose that the system has been formedbycontinually bringing from a very great distance infinitesimalquantities of electricity, proportional to the quantities alreadypresent at the various points of the system ; so that the chargeis always distributed proportionally to the final distribution.Let e typify the final charge at any point of space, and Vthefinal potential at this point.

Helmholtz, moreover, applied the principle of energy to systems containing electric currents. For instance, when a magnet is moved in the vicinity of a current, the energy takenfrom the battery may be equated to the sum of that expendedas Joulian heat, and that communicated to the magnet by the
electromagnetic force : and this equation shows that the current
is not proportional to the electromotive force of the battery,
i.e. it reveals the existence of Faraday's magneto-electric
induction. As, however, Helmholtz was at the time un-acquainted with the conception of the electrokinetic energystored in connexion with a current, his equations were for themost part defective. But in the case of the mutual action of a current and a permanent magnet, he obtained the correct
result that the time-integral of the induced electromotive
force in the circuit is equal to the increase which takes
place in the potential of the magnet towards a current of a
certain strength in the circuit. The correct theory of the energy of magnetic and electro- magnetic fields is due mainly to W. Thomson (Lord Kelvin).
Thomson's researches on this subject commenced with one or two short investigations regarding the ponderomotive forces which act on temporary magnets. In 1847 he discussedt the
case of a small iron sphere placed in a magnetic field, showingthat it is acted on by a ponderomotive force represented by-
grad cR~, where c denotes a constant, and R denotes the magnetic
force of the field ; such a sphere must evidently tend to movetowards the places where E' is greatest. The same analysis
may be applied to explain why diamagnetic bodies tend to move, as in Faraday's experiments, from the stronger to the
weaker parts of the field.

Two years later Thomson presented to the Koyal Societyamemoir* in which the results of Poisson'a theory of magnetismwere derived from experimental data, without making useofthe hypothesis of magnetic fluids ; and this was followedin1850 by a second memoir,f in which Thomson drew attentionto the fact previously noticed by Poisson,J that the magneticintensity at a point within a magnetized body depends on theshape of the small cavity in which the exploring magnetisplaced. Thomson distinguished two vectors ; one of these, bylater writers generally denoted by B, represents the magneticintensity at a point situated in a small crevice in themagnetized body, when the faces of the crevice are at rightangles to the direction of magnetization ; the vector B is alwayscircuital. The other vector, generally denoted by H, representsthe magnetic intensity in a narrow tubular cavity tangentialto the direction of magnetization ; it is an irrotational vector.The magnetic potential tends at any point to a limit whichisindependent of the shape of the cavity in which the pointissituated ; and the space-gradient of this limit is identical withH. Thomson called B the " magnetic force according to theelectro-magnetic definition," and H the " magnetic force according to the polar definition
"
; but the names magnetic inductionand magnetic force, proposed by Maxwell, have been generallyused by later writers. It may be remarked that the vector to which Faradayapplied the term " magnetic force," and which he representedby lines of force, is not H, but B ; for the number of unit linesof force passing through any gap must depend only on the gap,and not on the particular diaphragm filling up the gap, acrosswhich the flux is estimated ; and this can be the case only if thevector which is represented by the lines of force is a circuitalvector.

science as indeed he did into every science in which he wasinterested.

where K denotes the susceptibility. By an easy extension of Poisson's analysis it is seen that the magnetic induction andmagnetic force are connected by the equation
B = H + 47rl, where I denotes the total intensity of magnetization : so if I denote the permanent magnetization, we have
B = H + 47rl + 47rl,,, = )uH + 47rI , where //, denotes (1 + 4) : //, was called by Thomson thepermeability.
In 1851 Thomson extended his magnetic theory so as to include magnecrystallic phenomena. The mathematical foundations of the theory of magnecrystallic action had been laid byanticipation, long before the experimental discovery of the
phenomenon, in a memoir read by Poisson to the Academy in February, 1824. Poisson, as will be remembered, had supposedtemporary magnetism to be due to
" magnetic fluids," movablewithin the infinitely small " magnetic elements " of which heassumed magnetizable matter to be constituted. He had notoverlooked the possibility that in crystals these magneticelements might be non-spherical (e.g. ellipsoidal), and symmetrically arranged ; and had remarked that a portion of sucha crystal, when placed in a magnetic field, would act in a manner depending on its orientation.

the induced magnetization I with the magnetizing force Hhehad given in a form equivalent to
( Ix = aHx + b'ffy + c"ffz , Iy = a"Hx + bHy + c'HZ) Iz = a'Hr + b"Hy + cHz. Thomson now* showed that the nine coefficients a, b'', c" . . ., introduced by Poisson, are not independent of each other. Fora sphere composed of the magnecrystalline substance, if placedin a uniform field of force, would be acted on by a couple : andthe work done by this couple when the sphere, supposedofunit volume, performs a complete revolution round the axis ofxmay be easily shown to be 7rH(l - H^j IP) (- &" + c).

" the value of a current inaclosed conductor, left without electromotive force, is thequantity of work that would be got by letting all the infinitelysmall currents into which it may be divided along the lines ofmotion of the electricity come together from an infinite distance,and make it up. Each of these ' infinitely small currents
' is ofcourse in a circuit which is generally of finite length ; it is thesection of each partial conductor and the strength of the currentin it that must be infinitely small."

Middle of the Nineteenth Century. 247Discussing next the mutual energy due to the approach of a permanent magnet and a circuit carrying a current, he arrived
at the remarkable conclusion that in this case there is noelectrokinetic energy which depends on the mutual action ; the
energy is simply the sum of that due to the permanent magnetsand that due to the currents. If a permanent magnet is caused to approach a circuit carrying a current, the electromotive
force acting in the circuit is thereby temporarily increased ; the
amount of energy dissipated as Joulian heat, and the speed of the chemical reactions in the cells, are temporarily increased also. But the increase in the Joulian heat is exactly equal to the
increase in the energy derived from consumption of chemicals,
together with the mechanical work done on the magnet by the
operator who moves it ; so that the balance of energy is perfect,
and none needs to be added to or taken from the electrokinetic
form. It will now be evident why it was that Helmholtzescaped in this case the errors into which he was led in other
cases by his neglect of electrokinetic energy ; for in this case there was no electrokinetic energy to neglect.
Two years later, in 1853, Thomson* gave a new form to the
expression for the energy of a system of permanent andtemporary magnets.
We have seen that the energy of such a system is represented
by
where p denotes the density of Poisson's equivalent magnetization for the permanent magnets, and <f> denotes the magneticpotential, and where the integration may be extended over the
whole of space. Substituting for pn its value - div I ,f the
expression may be written in the form

In the same memoir Thomson returned to the question of theenergy which is possessed by a circuit in virtue of an electriccurrent circulating in it. As he remarked, the energy maybe determined by calculating the amount of work whichmust be done in and on the circuit in order to double thecircuit on itself while the current is sustained in it withconstant strength; for Faraday's experiments show thatacircuit doubled on itself has no stored energy. Thomson foundthat the amount of work required may be expressed in the form\Li*, where i denotes the current strength, and L, whichiscalled the coefficient of self-induction^ depends only on the formofthe circuit. It may be noticed that in the doubling process the inherent* The form actually given by Thomson was

used to save the energy which would otherwise be furnished bythe battery, and which is expended in Joulian heat. Thomson next proceeded* to show that the energy which is stored in connexion with a circuit in which a current is flowing
may be expressed as a volume-integral extended over the wholeof space, similar to the integral by which he had already
represented the energy of a system of permanent and temporarymagnets. The theorem, as originally stated by its author,
applied only to the case of a single circuit; but it may be
established for a system formed by any number of circuits in the following way : If N8 denote the number of unit tubes of magnetic induction
which are linked with the &
h circuit, in which a current is is flowing, the electrokinetic energy of the system is JSJV,^; whichmay be written |2/r, where /r denotes the total current flowing
through the gap formed by the r
th unit tube of magnetic induction. But if H denote the (vector) magnetic force, and Hits numerical magnitude, it is known that (l/4?r) J Hds, integrated
along a closed line of magnetic induction, measures the total current flowing through the gap formed by the line. Theenergy is therefore (l/8?r)S jffds, the summation being extended
over all the unit tubes of magnetic induction, and the integration being taken along them. But if dS denote the cross-section
of one of these tubes, we have BdS = 1, where B denotes the
numerical magnitude of the magnetic induction B : so the energyis (11'Sir) SBdS/ Hds ; and as the tubes fill all space, we mayreplace 'S.dSjds by ^dxdydz. Thus the energy takes the form(l/8?r) JJf BHdxdydz, where the integration is extended over the
whole of space ; and since in the present case B = pH, the energy
may also be represented by (Il8v)ffffjjrdxdydz.

But this is identical with the form which was obtained fora field due to permanent and temporary magnets. It thusappears that in all cases the stored energy of a systemofelectric currents and permanent and temporary magnets is
-' dxdydz,
where the integration is extended over all space.
It must, however, be remembered that this represents onlywhat in thermodynamics is called the " available energy
"
; andit must further be remembered that part even of this availableenergy may not be convertible into mechanical work within thelimitations of the system : e.g., the electrokinetic energy ofacurrent flowing in a single closed perfectly conducting circuitcannot be converted into any other form so long as the circuitis absolutely rigid. All that we can say is that the changesinthis stored electrokinetic energy correspond to the work furnishedby the system in any change.
The above form suggests that the energy may not be localizedin the substance of the circuits and magnets, but may be distri-buted over the whole of space, an amount (pH2 /Sir) of energybeing contained in each unit volume. This conception wasafterwards adopted by Maxwell, in whose theory it is offundamental importance.
While Thomson was investigating the energy storedinconnexion with electric currents, the equations of flow of thecurrents were being generalized by Gustav Kirchhoff (b. 1824,d. 1887). In 1848 Kirchhoff* extended Ohm's theory of linearconduction to the case of conduction in three dimensions ; thiscould be done without much difficulty by making use of theanalogy with the flow of heat, which had proved so usefultoOhm. In Kirchhoffs memoir a system is supposed to beformed of three-dimensional conductors, through which steadycurrents are flowing. At any point let V denote the " tension"or
" electroscopic force
" a quantity the significance of which*Ann.d. Phys. Ixxv (1848), p. 189: Kirchhoff's Ges. AbhandL, p. 33.

425lin electrostatics was not yet correctly known. Then, within
the substance of any homogeneous conductor, the function Vmust satisfy Laplace's equation V- V= ; while at the air-surface
of each conductor, the derivate of V taken along the normalmust vanish. At the interface between two conductors formedof different materials, the function V has a discontinuity,
which is measured by the value of Volta's contact force for the
two conductors ; and, moreover, the condition that the current
shall be continuous across such an interface requires that
Jed VfoN shall be continuous, where k denotes the ohmic specific
conductivity of the conductor, and 3/3^ denotes differentiation along the normal to the interface. The equations which havenow been mentioned suffice to determine the flow of electricity in the system.
Kirchhoff also showed that the currents distribute themselves in the conductors in such a way as to generate the least possible amount of Joulian heat ; as is easily seen, since the
quantity of Joulian heat generated in unit time is
where k, as before, denotes the specific conductivity ; and this integral has a stationary value when V satisfies the equation

Kirchhoff next applied himself to establish harmony betweenelectrostatical conceptions and the theory of Ohm. Thattheory had now been before the world for twenty years, andhad been verified by numerous experimental researches ; in
particular, a careful investigation was made at this time (1848)
by Kudolph Kohlrausch (b. 1809, d. 1858), who showed* that
the difference of the electric " tensions
" at the extremities of a
voltaic cell, measured electrostatically with the circuit open, was for different cells proportional to the electromotive force *Ann. d. Phys. Ixxv (1848), p. 220.
252 The Mathematical Electricians of the
measured by the electrodynamic effects of the cell with thecircuit closed ; and, further,* that when the circuit was closed,the difference of the tensions, measured electrostatically, at anytwo points of the outer circuit was proportional to the ohmicresistance existing between them. But in spite of all that hadbeen done, it was still uncertain how " tension," or
" electro-scopic force," or
" electromotive force
" should be interpretedin the language of theoretical electrostatics ; it will beremembered that Ohm himself, perpetuating a confusion whichhad originated with Volta, had identified electroscopic forcewith density of electric charge, and had assumed that theelectricity in a conductor is at rest when it is distributeduniformly throughout the substance of the conductor.
The uncertainty was finally removed in 1849 by Kirchhoff,fwho identified Ohm's electroscopic force with the electrostaticpotential. That this identification is correct may be seenbycomparing the different expressions which have been obtainedfor electric energy; Helmholtz's expression^ shows that theenergy of a unit charge at any place is proportional to thevalue of the electrostatic potential at that place ; while Joule'sresult shows that the energy liberated by a unit chargeinpassing from one place in a circuit to another is proportionalto the difference of the electric tensions at the two places. Itfollows that tension and potential are the same thing.
The work of Kirchhoff was followed by several otherinvestigations which belong to the borderland between electrostatics and electrodynamics. One of the first of these wasthestudy of the Leyden jar discharge.
Early in the century Wollaston, in the course of his experiments on the decomposition of water, had observed that whenthe decomposition is effected by a discharge of static electricity,the hydrogen and oxygen do not appear at separate electrodes; but that at each electrode there is evolved a mixture of the* Ann. d.

directions. After this F. Savary* had noticed that the
discharge of a Leyden jar magnetizes needles in alternating
layers, and had conjectured that " the electric motion during
the discharge consists of a series of oscillations." A similar
remark was made in connexion with a similar observation by
Joseph Henry (ft. 1799, d. 1878), of Washington, in 1842.f
" The phenomena," he wrote,
" require us to admit the existence
of a principal discharge in one direction, and then several reflex actions backward and forward, each more feeble than the
preceding, until equilibrium is restored." Helmholtz hadrepeated the same suggestion in his essay on the conservation
of energy : and in 1853 W. ThomsonJ verified it, byinvestigating the mathematical theory of the discharge, as
follows : Let C denote the capacity of the jar, i.e., the measure of the
charge when there is unit difference of potential between "the coatings ; let R denote the ohmic resistance of the discharging
circuit, and L its coefficient of self-induction. Then if at any instant t the charge of the condenser be Q, and the current in the wire be i, we have i = dQ/dt ; while Ohm's law,
modified by taking self-induction into account, gives the
equation
Eliminating i, we have
an equation which shows that when IFC < 4Z, the subsidence
of Q to zero is effected by oscillations of period

This simple result may be regarded as the beginning of thetheory of electric oscillations. Thomson was at this time much engaged in the problemsof submarine telegraphy; and thus he was led to examinethe vexed question of the "
velocity of electricity
" over longinsulated wires and cables. Various workers had madeexperiments on this subject at different times, but withhopelessly discordant results. Their attempts had generallytaken the form of measuring the interval of time betweentheappearance of sparks at two spark-gaps in the same circuit,between which a great length of wire intervened, but whichwere brought near each other in order that the dischargesmight be seen together. In one series of experiments,performed by Watson at Shooter's Hill in 1747-8,* the circuitwas four miles in length, two miles through wire and twomiles through the ground ; but the discharges appeared to beperfectly simultaneous; whence Watson concluded that thevelocity of propagation of electric effects is too great to bemeasurable.
In 1834 Charles Wheatstone,f Professor of ExperimentalPhilosophy in King's College, London, by examining inarevolving mirror sparks formed a,t the extremities of a circuit,found the velocity of electricity in a copper wire to be aboutone and a half times the velocity of light. In 1850 H. Fizeauand E. GounelleJ experimenting with the telegraph lines fromParis to Eouen and to Amiens, obtained a velocity about onethird that of light for the propagation of electricity in an ironwire, and nearly two-thirds that of light for the propagationin a copper wire. The first step towards explaining these discrepancies wasmade by Faraday, who early in 1854 showed experimentallythat a submarine cable, formed of copper wire covered with* Phil.

" may be assimilated exactly to an immenseLeyden battery ; the glass of the jars represents the guttapercha ; the internal coating is the surface of the copper wire,"
while the outer cgating corresponds to the sea-water. It follows that in all calculations relating to the propagation of
electric disturbances along submarine cables, the electrostatic capacity of the cable must be taken into account. The theory of signalling by cable originated in a corre- spondence between Stokes and Thomson in 1854. In the case
of long submarine lines, the speed of signalling is so muchlimited by the electrostatic factor that electro-magnetic induction has no sensible effect ; and it was accordingly neglected in the investigation. In view of other applications of the analysis; however, we shall suppose that the cable has a self-induction Lper unit length, and that E denotes the ohmic resistance, andC the capacity per unit length, Fthe electric potential at a
distance x from one terminal, and i the current at this place.

obtained this equation in the form which applies to Atlantic

the same as Fourier's equation for the linear propagationofheat : so that the known solutions of Fourier's theory mayheused in a new interpretation. If we substitute
v - /,2<V - i -j- \x y t/ > we obtain
A, = (1 + -v/^l) (nCR)l J and therefore a typical elementary solution of the equation is V = e -(nCR^x sin \2nt -
(nCR)^x}.
The form of this solution shows that if a regular harmonicvariation of potential is applied at one end of a cable, the phaseis propagated with a velocity which is proportional to thesquare root of the frequency of the oscillations : since thereforethe different harmonics are propagated with different velocities,it is evident that no definite " velocity of transmission "
is tobeexpected for ordinary signals. If a potential is suddenly appliedat one end of the cable, a certain time elapses before the currentat the other end attains a definite percentage of its maximumvalue ; but it may easily be shown* that this retardationisproportional to the square of the length of the cable, so thatthe apparent velocity of propagation would be less, the greaterthe length of cable used.
The case of a telegraph line insulated in the air on polesisdifferent from that of a cable ; for here the capacity is small,and it is necessary to take into account the inductance. If inthe general equation of telegraphy we write
V = enx^~l + P
l , we obtain the equation R (R* n* \i

Middle of the Nineteenth Century. 257this shows that any harmonic disturbance, and therefore any
disturbance whatever, is propagated along the wire with
velocity (CL}~\ The difference between propagation in an
aerial wire and propagation in an oceanic cable is, as Thomson
remarked, similar to the difference between the propagation
of an impulsive pressure through a long column of fluid in a tube when the tube is rigid (case of the aerial wire) and whenit is elastic, so as to be capable of local distension (case of the
cable, the distension corresponding to the effect of capacity) : in the former case, as is well known, the impulse is propagated
with a definite velocity, namely, the velocity of sound in the
fluid.The work of Thomson on signalling along cables was followed
in 1857 by a celebrated investigation* of Kirchhoff's, on the
propagation of electric disturbance along an aerial wire of circular cross- section. Kirchhoff assumed that the electric charge is practically all resident on the surface of the wire, and that the current is uniformly distributed over its cross-section; his idea of the current was the same as that of Fechner and Weber, namely,
that it consists of equal streams of vitreous and resinous electricity flowing in opposite directions. Denoting the electric potential by V, the charge per unit length of wire by e, the
length of the wire by I, and the radius of its cross-section by a, he showed that Fis determined approximately by the equationf
V = 2e log (I/a). * Ann. d. Phys. c (1857), pp. 193, 251 : Kirchhoff's Ges. Abhandl., p. iai ; Phil. Mag. xiii (1857), p. 393. t His method of obtaining this equation was to calculate separately the effects of
(1) the portion of the wire within a distance e on either side of the point considered, where e denotes a length small compared with J, but large compared with o, and (2) the rest of the wire. He thus obtained the equation
where the integration is to be taken over all the length of the wire except the
portion 2e : the equation given in the text was then derived by an, approximation,. which, however, is open to some objection. S

The next factor to be considered is the mutual inductionofthe current-elements in different parts of the wire. Assumingwith Weber that the electromotive force induced in an elementds due to another element ds' carrying a current i' is derivablefrom a vector-potential
,.3 Kirchhoff found for the vector-potential due to the entire wirethe approximate value
w = 2i log (//a),
where i denotes the strength of the current ;* the vectorpotential being directed parallel to the wire. Ohm's law thengives the equation

where k denotes the specific conductivity of the materialofwhich the wire is composed; and finally the principle ofconservation of electricity gives the equation

involved the calculation of the capacity and self-induction of the wire, and is thus able to supply the definite values of the
quantities which were left undetermined in the general equation
of telegraphy.
The velocity c, whose importance was thus demonstrated, has
already been noticed in connexion with Weber's law of force ; it is a factor of proportionality, which must be introduced whenelectrodynamic phenomena are described in terms of units whichhave been defined electrostatically,f or conversely when units
which have been defined electrodynamicallyj are used in the
description of electrostatic phenomena. That the factor whichis introduced on such occasions must be of the dimensions
(length/time), may be easily seen : for the electrostatic re- pulsion between electric charges is a quantity of the same kind
as the electrodynamic repulsion between two definite lengths of wire, carrying currents which may be specified by the amountof charge which travels past any point in unit time. Shortly before the publication of Kirchhoffs memoir, the
value of c had been determined by Weber and Kohlrausch ; their determination rested on a comparison of the measures of the
charge of a Leyden jar, as obtained by a method dependingon electrostatic attraction, and by a method depending on the
* In referring to the original memoirs of Weber and Kirchhoff, it must he remembered that the quantity which in the present work is denoted by e, and
which represents the velocity of light in free aether, was by these writers denoted by c/V'2. Weber, in fact, denoted by c the relative velocity with which two charges must approach each other in order that the force between them, as calculated by
his formula, should vanish.
It must also be remembered that those writers who accepted the hypothesis
that currents consist of equal and opposite streams of vitreous and resinous
electricity, were accustomed to write 2t to denote the current-strength.

magnetic effects of the current produced by discharging the jar.The resulting value was nearly
c = 3*1 x 1010 cm./sec.;
which was the same, within the limits of the errors of measurement, as the speed with which light travels in interplanetaryspace. The coincidence was noticed by Kirchhoff, who was thusthe first to discover the important fact that the velocity withwhich an electric disturbance is propagated along a perfectlyconducting aerial wire is equal to the velocity of light.
In a second memoir published in the same year, Kirchhoff*extended the equations of propagation of electric disturbanceto the case of three-dimensional conductors.
As in his earlier investigation, he divided the electromotiveforce at any point into two parts, of which one is the gradientof the electrostatic potential </>, and the other is the derivatewith respect to the time (with sign reversed) of a vector-potential a ; so that if i denote the current and k the specificconductivity, Ohm's law is expressed by the equation

greatly influenced by those of Weber. The latter investigations, however, did not enjoy unquestioned authority ; for there was still a question as to whether the expressions given by
Weber for the mutual energy of two current elements, and for the mutual energy of two electrons, were to be preferred to the
rival formulae of Neumann and Eiemann. The matter wasexamined in 1870 by Helmholtz, in a series of memoirs* to which reference has already been made.f Helmholtz remarked
that, for two elements ds, ds', carrying currents i, i', the electro- dynamic energy is n'(ds.ds') r

ee' (xx + yy + zz - c
2 ), which, as will appear later, closely resembles the correspondingexpression in the modern theory of electrons. Clausius' formula has the great advantage over Weber's, thatit does not compel us to assume equal and opposite velocitiesfor the vitreous and resinous charges in an electric current;on the other hand, Clausius' expression involves the absolutevelocities of the electrons, while Weber's depends only on theirrelative motion; and therefore Clausius' theory requires theassumption of a fixed aether in space, to which the velocitiesv and V may be referred. When the behaviour of finite electrical systems is predictedfrom the formulae of Weber, Eiemann, and Clausius, the threelaws do not always lead to concordant results. For instance,ifa circular current be rotated with constant angular velocityround its axis, according to Weber's law there would beadevelopment of free electricity on a stationary conductor in theneighbourhood ; whereas, according to Clausius' formula therewould be no induction on a stationary body, but electrification

Again,* let a magnet be suspendedwithin a hollow metallic body, and let the hollow body besuddenly charged or discharged; then, according to Clausius' theory, the magnet is unaffected; but according to Weber'sand Kiemann's theories it experiences an impulsive couple.
And again, if an electrified disk be rotated in its own plane,
under certain circumstances a steady current will be induced in a neighbouring circuit according to Weber's law, but not
according to the other formulae.
An interesting objection to Clausius' theory was broughtforward in 1879 by Frohlichf namely, that when a charge of free electricity and a constant electric current are at rest relatively to each other, but partake together of the translatory
motion of the earth in space, a force should act between them if Clausius' law were true. It was, however, shown by BuddeJthat the circuit itself acquires an electrostatic charge, partly
as a result of the same action which causes the force on the
external conductor, and partly as a result of electrostatic induction by the charge on the external conductor ; and that the
total force between the circuit and external conductor is thusreduced to zero. We have seen that the discrimination between the different laws of electrodynamic force is closely connected with the
question whether in an electric current there are two kinds of
electricity moving in opposite directions, or only one kindmoving in one direction. On the unitary hypothesis, that the

that the electricity induced on the conductor carrying the current neutralizes the ponderomotive force between the current and the external charge.

current consists in a transport of one kind of electricity withadefinite velocity relative to the wire, it might be expected thata coil rotated rapidly about its own axis would generateamagnetic field different from that produced by the same coilat rest. Experiments to determine the matter were performedby A. Foppl* and by E. L. Nichols and W. S. Franklin,f butwith negative results. The latter investigators found that thevelocity of electricity must be such that the quantity conveyedpast a specified point in a unit of time, when the direction ofthe current was that in which the coil was travelling, did notdiffer from that transferred when the current and coil weremoving in opposite directions by as much as one part in tenmillion, even when the velocity of the wire was 9096 cm./sec.They considered that they would have been able to detecta change of deflexion due to the motion of the coil, even thoughthe velocity of the current had been considerably greater thana thousand million metres per second. During the decades in the middle of the century considerable progress was made in the science of thermo-electricity,whose beginnings we have already described. J In Faraday'slaboratory note-book, under the date July 28th, 1836, weread : " Surely the converse of thermo-electricity ought to beobtained experimentally. Pass current through a circuit ofantimony and bismuth."
Unknown to Faraday, the experiment here indicated hadalready been made, although its author had arrived at it byadifferent train of ideas. In 1834 Jean Charles Peltier|| (b. 1785,d. 1845) attempted the task, which was afterwards performedwith success by Joule,1J of measuring the heat evolved by thepassage of an electric current through a conductor. He foundthat a current produces in a homogeneous conductor an elevation* Ann. d. Phys. xxvii (1886), p. 410. t Amer. Jour. Sci., xxxvii (1889), p. 103. J

where the cross-section is the same ; but he did not succeed in connecting the thermal phenomena quantitatively with the
strength of .the current a failure which was due chiefly to the
circumstance that his attention was fixed on the rise of temperature rather than on the amount of the heat evolved. But incidentally the investigation led to an important discovery
namely, that when a current was passed in succession through
two conductors made of dissimilar metals, there was an evolution
of heat at the junction ; and that this depended on the direction of the current ; for if the junction was heated when the current
flowed in one sense, it was cooled when the current flowed in the
opposite sense. This Peltier effect, as it is called, is quite distinct from the ordinary Joulian liberation of heat, in which the
amount of energy set free in the thermal form is unaffected by
a reversal of the current ; the Joulian effect is, in fact, proportional to the square of the current-strength, while the Peltier
effect is proportional to the current-strength directly. The
Peltier heat which is absorbed from external sources when a
current i flows for unit time through a junction from one metal
B to another metal A may therefore be denoted by
where T denotes the absolute temperature of the junction. The
function n^ (T) is found to be expressible as the difference of two parts, of which one depends on the metal A only, and the
other on the metal B only ; thus we can write

metals, A and B, and let one junction be maintained ataslightly higher temperature (T + $T) than the temperatureTof the other junction. As Seebeck had shown, a thermo-electriccurrent will be set up in the circuit. Thomson saw that sucha system might be regarded as a heat-engine, which absorbsacertain quantity of heat at the hot junction, and converts partof this into electrical energy, liberating the rest in the formofheat at the cold junction. If the Joulian evolution of heatbeneglected, the process is reversible, and must obey the secondlaw of thermodynamics ; that is, the sum of the quantitiesofheat absorbed, each divided by the absolute temperatureatwhich it is absorbed, must vanish. Thus we have
T+ST
so the Peltier effect H^(T) must be directly proportionaltothe absolute temperature T. This result, however, as Thomsonwell knew, was contradicted by the observations of Gumming,who had shown that when the temperature of the hot junctionis graduallyincreased, the electromotive force rises to a maximumvalue and then decreases. The contradiction led Thomsontopredict the existence of a hitherto unrecognized thermo-electricphenomenon namely, a reversible absorption of heat at placesin the circuit other than the junctions. Suppose that a currentflows along a wire which is of the same metal throughout, butvaries in temperature from point to point. Thomson showedthat heat must be liberated at some points and absorbedatothers, so as either to accentuate or to diminish the differencesof temperature at the different points of the wire.

This equation connects Thomson's "
specific heat of electricity"
SA (T) with the Peltier effect. In 1870 P. G. Tait* found experimentally that the specific
heat of electricity in pure metals is proportional to the absolute
temperature. We may therefore write SA (T) = aA T, where
aA denotes a constant characteristic of the metal A. Thethermodynamical equation then becomes

The chief part of the Peltier effect arises from the term irA T. By the investigations which have been described in the
present chapter, the theory of electric currents was considerably
advanced in several directions. In all these researches, however, attention was fixed on the conductor carrying the current
as the seat of the phenomenon. In the following period, interest was centred not so much on the conductors which carry charges
and currents, as on the processes which take place in the
dielectric media .around them.

CHAPTEE VIII.
MAXWELL.
SINCE the time of Descartes, natural philosophers have neverceased to speculate on the manner in which electric andmagnetic influences are transmitted through space. Aboutthe middle of the nineteenth century, speculation assumedadefinite form, and issued in a rational theory.
Among those who thought much on the matter was KarlFriedrich Gauss (b. 1777, d. 1855). In a letter* to Weberofdate March 19, 1845, Gauss remarked that he had long agoproposed to himself to supplement the known forces whichactbetween electric charges by other forces, such as would causeelectric actions to be propagated between the charges withafinite velocity. But he expressed himself as determined notto publish his researches until he should have devisedamechanism by which the transmission could be conceivedtobe effected ; and this he had not succeeded in doing.
More than one attempt to realize Gauss's aspiration wasmade by his pupil Eiemann. In a fragmentary note,t whichappears to have been written in 1853, but which was notpublished until after his death, Biemann proposed an aetherwhose elements should be endowed with the power of resistingcompression, and also (like the elements of MacCullagh'saether) of resisting changes of orientation. The former property he conceived to be the cause of gravitational andelectrostatic effects, and the latter to be the cause of opticaland magnetic phenomena. The theory thus outlined wasapparently not developed further by its author ; but in a shortinvestigation^ which was published posthumously in 1867, he* Gauss' Werke, v, p. 629. t Riemann's Werke, 2

Maxwell. 269returned to the question of the process by which electric action
is propagated through space. In this memoir he proposed to replace Poisson's equation for the electrostatic potential,
namely,
by the equation
according to which the changes of potential due to changing
electrification would be propagated outwards from the charges
with a velocity c. This, so far as it goes, is in agreement with
the view which is now accepted as correct ; but Kiemann's
hypothesis was too slight to serve as the basis of a complete
theory. Success came only when the properties of the inter- vening medium were taken into account. In that power to which Gauss attached so much importance,
of devising dynamical models and analogies for obscure physical
phenomena, perhaps no one has ever excelled W. Thomson*;
and to him, jointly with Faraday, is due the credit of having
initiated the theory of the electric medium. In one of his
earliest papers, written at the age of seventeen,! Thomsoncompared the distribution of electrostatic force, in a region
containing electrified conductors, with the distribution of the
flow of heat in an infinite solid : the equipotential surfaces in the one case correspond to the isothermal surfaces in the other,
and an electric charge corresponds to a source of heat.J * As will appear from the present chapter, Maxwell had the same power in a
very marked degree. It has always been cultivated hy the "

It may, perhaps, seem as if the value of such an analogyas this consisted merely in the prospect which it offeredofcomparing, and thereby extending, the mathematical theoriesof heat and electricity. But to the physicist its chief interestlay rather in the idea that formulae which relate to the electricfield, and which had heen deduced from laws of action atadistance, were shown to be identical with formulae relatingtothe theory of heat, which had been deduced from hypothesesof action between contiguous particles.
In 1846 the year after he had taken his degree as secondwrangler at Cambridge Thomson investigated* the analogiesof electric phenomena with those of elasticity. For this purposehe examined the equations of equilibrium of an incompressibleelastic solid which is in a state of strain ; and showedthatthe distribution of the vector which represents the elasticdisplacement might be assimilated to the distribution of theelectric force in an electrostatic system. This, however, ashewent on to show, is not the only analogy which maybeperceived with the equations of elasticity ; for the elasticdisplacement may equally well be identified with a vectora,defined in terms of the magnetic induction B by the relationcurl a = B. The vector a is equivalent to the vector-potential whichhad been used in the memoirs of Neumann, Weber,andKirchhoff, on the induction of currents ; but Thomson arrivedat it independently by a different process, and without beingatthe time aware of the identification. The results of Thomson's memoir seemed to suggestapicture of the propagation of electric or magnetic force : mightit not take place in somewhat the same way as changes in theelastic displacement are transmitted through an elastic solid?These suggestions were not at the time pursued furtherby their author; but they helped to inspire another young* Camb. and Dub.

Cambridge man to take up the matter a few years later. James Clerk Maxwell, by whom the problem was eventually
solved, was born in 1831, the son of a landed proprietor in Dumfriesshire. He was educated at Edinburgh, and at Trinity
College, Cambridge, of which society he became in 1855 a Fellow; and not long after his election to Fellowship, he
communicated to the Cambridge Philosophical Society the first of his endeavours* to form a mechanical conception of the
electro-magnetic field. Maxwell had been reading Faraday's Experimental Hesearches', and, gifted as he was with a physical imagination
akin to Faraday's, he had been profoundly impressed by the
theory of lines of force. At the same time, he was a trained
mathematician ; and the distinguishing feature of almost all his researches was the union of the imaginative and the
analytical faculties to produce results partaking of both
natures. This first memoir may be regarded as an attempt to connect the ideas of Faraday with the mathematical analogies
which had been devised by Thomson.
Maxwell considered first the illustration of Faraday's lines
of force which is afforded by the lines of flow of a liquid. Thelines of force represent the direction of a vector; and the
magnitude of this vector is everywhere inversely proportional
to the cross-section of a narrow tube formed by such lines. This relation between magnitude and direction is possessed by
any circuital vector ; and in particular by the vector which
represents the velocity at any point in a fluid, if the fluid be
incompressible. It is therefore possible to represent the
magnetic induction B, which is the vector represented by
Faraday's lines of magnetic force, as the velocity of an incompressible fluid. Such an analogy had been indicated some
years previously by Faraday himself,f who had suggested that
along the lines of magnetic force there may be a
" dynamic
condition," analogous to that of the electric current, and

272 Maxwell.
that, in fact,
" the physical lines of magnetic force arecurrents." The comparison with the lines of flow of a liquidisapplicable to electric as well as to magnetic lines of force. Inthis case the vector which corresponds to the velocity of thefluid is, in free aether, the electric force E. But when differentdielectrics are present in the field, the electric force is notacircuital vector, and, therefore cannot be represented by linesof force ; in fact, the equation
div E =
is now replaced by the equation
div(eE) = 0, where g denotes the specific inductive capacity or dielectricconstant at the place (x, y} z\ It is, however, evident fromthis equation that the vector cE is circuital ; this vector,which will be denoted by D, bears to E a relation similartothat which the magnetic induction B bears to the magneticforce H. It is the vector D which is represented by Faraday'slines of electric force, and which in the hydrodynamicalanalogy corresponds to the velocity of the incompressible fluid.In comparing fluid motion with electric fields it is necessaryto introduce sources and sinks into the fluid to correspondtothe electric charges ; for D is not circuital at places where there,is free charge. The magnetic analogy is therefore somewhatthe simpler.
In the latter half of his memoir Maxwell discussed howFaraday's "electrotonic state" might be represented in mathematical symbols. This problem he solved by borrowing fromThomson's investigation of 1847 the vector a, which is definedin terms of the magnetic induction by the equation
curl a = B ;
if, with Maxwell, we call a the electrotonic intensity, the.equation is equivalent to the statement that " the entireelectrotonic intensity round the boundary of any surfacemeasures the number of lines of magnetic force which pass,
Maxwell. 273
through that surface." The electromotive force of induction at the place (x, y, z) is - d&/dt : as Maxwell said,
" the electromotive
force on any element of a conductor is measured by the
instantaneous rate of change of the electrotonic intensity on
that element." From this it is evident that a is no other than
the vector-potential which had been employed by Neumann,
Weber, and Kirchhoff, in the calculation of induced currents ; and we may take* for the electrotonic intensity due to a current i
r flowing in a circuit s' the value which results from
Neumann's theory, namely,
., f *s' = t' } r
It may, however, be remarked that the equation
curl a = B,
taken alone, is insufficient to determine a uniquely ; for we can
choose a so as to satisfy this, and also to satisfy the equation
div a =
;//, where i// denotes any arbitrary scalar. There are, therefore, an
infinite number of possible functions a. With the particular
value of a which has been adopted, we have
3 ., f dx' 8 f dy' 8 ., f dz
div a = - i \ - + ^' -2- + - i' \ te I' r fy ) 8
, r dz J, r ., *
= 0;
so the vector-potential a which we have chosen is circuital. In this memoir the physical importance of the operators
curl and div first became evidentf ; for, in addition to those
applications which have been mentioned, Maxwell showed that

he connexion between the strength i of a current andthemagnetic field H, to which it gives rise, may be representedbythe equation
4?ri = curl H ; this equation is equivalent to the statement that " the entiremagnetic intensity round the boundary of any surface measuresthe quantity of electric current which passes throughthatsurface." In the same year (1856) in which Maxwell's investigationwas published, Thomson* put forward an alternative inter-pretation of magnetism. He had now come to the conclusion,from a study of the magnetic rotation of the plane of polarization of light, that magnetism possesses a rotatory character;and suggested that the resultant angular momentum ofthethermal motions of a bodyf might be taken as the measureofthe magnetic moment. " The explanation," he wrote,
" ofallphenomena of electromagnetic attraction or repulsion, orofelectromagnetic induction, is to be looked for simply in theinertia or pressure of the matter of which the motionsconstitute heat. Whether this matter is or is not electricity,whether it is a continuous fluid interpermeating the spacesbetween molecular nuclei, or is itself molecularly grouped: orwhether all matter is continuous, and molecular heterogeneousness consists in finite vortical or other relative motionsofcontiguous parts of a body: it is impossible to decide, and,perhaps, in vain to speculate, in the present state of science."The two interpretations of magnetism, in which the linearand rotatory characters respectively are attributed to it, occurfrequently in the subsequent history of the subject. Theformer was amplified in 1858, when Helmholtz publishedhisresearches^ on vortex motion ; for Helmholtz showed that ifa*Proc. Roy. Soc. viii (1856), p. 150 ; xi (1861), p. 327, foot-note: Phil.

magnetic field produced by electric currents is compared to the
flow of an incompressible fluid, so that the magnetic vector is represented by the fluid velocity, then the electric currents correspond to the vortex-filaments in the fluid. This analogy
correlates many theorems in hydrodynamics and electricity ; for instance, the theorem that a re-entrant vortex-filament is equivalent to a uniform distribution of doublets over any
surface bounded by it, corresponds to Ampere's theorem of the
equivalence of electric currents and magnetic shells. In his memoir of 1855, Maxwell had not attempted to construct a mechanical model of electrodynamic actions, but
had expressed his intention of doing so. " By a careful study,"
he wrote,*
" of the laws of elastic solids, and of the motions of viscous fluids, I hope to discover a method of forming a mechanical conception of this electrotonic state adapted to general reasoning
"
; and in a foot-note he referred to the effort which Thomson had already made in this direction. Six years
elapsed, however, before anything further on the subject waspublished. In the meantime, Maxwell became Professor of Natural Philosophy in King's College, London a position in
which he had opportunities of personal contact with Faraday,
whom he had long reverenced. Faraday had now concluded
the Experimental Researches, and was living in retirement at Hampton Court ; but his thoughts frequently recurred to the
great problem which he had brought so near to solution. It appears from his note-book that in 1857f he was speculating
whether the velocity of propagation of magnetic action is of the same order as that of light, and whether it is affected by the
susceptibility to induction of the bodies through which the
action is transmitted.
The answer to this question was furnished in 1861-2,
when Maxwell fulfilled his promise of devising a mechanical
conception of the electromagnetic field.* * Maxwell's Scientific Papers, i, p. 188. t Bence Jones's Life of Faraday ii, p. 379.

276 Maxwell.
In the interval since the publication of his previous memoirMaxwell had become convinced by Thomson's arguments thatmagnetism is in its nature rotatory. "The transferenceofelectrolytes in fixed directions by the electric current, andtherotation of polarized light in fixed directions by magnetic force,are," he wrote, "the facts the consideration of whichhasinduced me to regard magnetism as a phenomenon of rotation,and electric currents as phenomena of translation." This con-ception of magnetism he brought into connexion with Faraday'sidea, that tubes of force tend to contract longitudinally andtoexpand laterally. Such a tendency may be attributedtocentrifugal force, if it be assumed that each tube of forcecontains fluid which is in rotation about the axis of the tube.Accordingly Maxwell supposed that, in any magnetic field, themedium whose vibrations constitute light is in rotation aboutthe lines of magnetic force; each unit tube of force may for thepresent be pictured as an isolated vortex. The energy of the motion per unit volume is proportionalto /jH
2
, where /j. denotes the density of the medium, andHdenotes the linear velocity at the circumference of each vortex.But, as we have seen,* Thomson had already shown that theenergy of any magnetic field, whether produced by magnetsorby electric currents, is
where the integration is taken over all space, and whereitdenotes the magnetic permeability, and H the magnetic force.It was therefore natural to identify the density of the mediumat any place with the magnetic permeability, and the circumferential velocity of the vortices with the magnetic force. But an objection to the proposed analogy now presentsitself. Since two neighbouring vortices rotate in the samedirection, the particles in the circumference of one vortex mustbe moving in the opposite direction to the particles contiguous* Cf. pp. 248, 250.
Maxwell. 277to them in the circumference of the adjacent vortex ; and it seems, therefore, as if the motion would be discontinuous.
Maxwell escaped from this difficulty by imitating a well-known
mechanical arrangement. When it is desired that two wheels
should revolve in the same sense, an " idle
" wheel is inserted
between them so as to be in gear with both. The model of the
electromagnetic field to which Maxwell arrived by the intro- duction of this device greatly resembles that proposed by
Bernoulli in 1736.* He supposed a layer of particles, acting as
idle wheels, to be interposed between each vortex and the next,
and to roll without sliding on the vortices ; so that each vortex
tends to make the neighbouring vortices revolve in the samedirection as itself. The particles were supposed to be not otherwise constrained, so that the velocity of the centre of anyparticle would be the mean of the circumferential velocities of the vortices between which it is placed. This condition yields
(in suitable units) the analytical equation
47Ti = curl H,
where the vector i denotes the flux of the particles, so that its ^-component ix denotes the quantity of particles transferred
in unit time across unit area perpendicular to the ^-direction. On comparing this equation with that which represents Oersted's
discovery, it is seen that the flux i of the movable particles
interposed between neighbouring vortices is the analogue of the electric current.
It will be noticed that in Maxwell's model the relation between electric current and magnetic force is secured by a connexion which is not of a dynamical, but of a purely kinematical character. The above equation simply expresses the
existence of certain non-holonomic constraints within the
system.
If from any cause the rotatory velocity of some of the
cellular vortices is altered, the disturbance will be propagated
from that part of the model to all other parts, by the mutual

action of the particles and vortices. This action is determined,as Maxwell showed, hy the relation
fj$L = - curl E
which connects E, the force exerted on a unit quantityofparticles at any place in consequence of the tangential actionof the vortices, with H, the rate of change of velocity of theneighbouring vortices. It will be observed that this equationis not kinematical but dynamical. On comparing it with theelectromagnetic equations
curl a =
/*H,
Induced electromotive force = - a,
it is seen that E must be interpreted electromagnetically as theinduced electromotive force. Thus the motion of the particlesconstitutes an electric current, the tangential force with whichthey are pressed by the matter of the vortex-cells constituteselectromotive force, and the pressure of the particles on eachother may be taken to correspond to the tension or potentialofthe electricity.
The mechanism must next be extended so as to take accountof the phenomena of electrostatics. For this purpose Maxwellassumed that the particles, when they are displaced from theirequilibrium position in any direction, exert a tangential actionon the elastic substance of the cells ; and that this gives riseto a distortion of the cells, which in turn calls into playaforce arising from their elasticity, equal and opposite to theforce which urges the particles away from the equilibriumposition. When the exciting force is removed, the cells recovertheir form, and the electricity returns to its former position.The state of the medium, in which the electric particles aredisplaced in a definite direction, is assumed to representanelectrostatic field. Such a displacement does not itself constitute a current, because when it has attained a certain valueit remains constant ; but the variations of displacement aretobe regarded as currents, in the positive or negative directionaccording as the displacement is increasing or diminishing.
Maxwell. 279The conception of the electrostatic state as a displacement
of something from its equilibrium position was not altogether
new, although it had not been previously presented in this form. Thomson, as we have seen, had compared electric force
to the displacement in an elastic solid ; and Faraday, who hadlikened the particles of a ponderable dielectric to small con- ductors embedded in an insulating medium,* had supposed that
when the dielectric is subjected to an electrostatic field, there
is a displacement of electric charge on each of the small
conductors. The motion of these charges, when the field is varied, is equivalent to an electric current ; and it was fromthis precedent that Maxwell derived the principle, which becameof cardinal importance in his theory, that variations of displacement are to be counted as currents. But in adopting the
idea, he altogether transformed it ; for Faraday's conception of displacement was applicable only to ponderable dielectrics, andwas in fact introduced solely in order to explain why the
specific inductive capacity of such dielectrics is different fromthat of free aether; whereas according to Maxwell there is displacement wherever there is electric force, whether material
bodies are present or not. The difference between the conceptions of Faraday andMaxwell in this respect may be illustrated by an analogydrawn from the theory of magnetism. When a piece of iron
is placed in a magnetic field, there is induced in it a magneticdistribution, say of intensity I ; this induced magnetizationexists only within the iron, being zero in the free aetheroutside. The vector I may be compared to the polarization

dielectrics by an electric field; and the electric current constituted by the variation of this polarization is then analogousto dl/dt.

merit-current corresponds to d'B/dt, and may therefore haveavalue different from zero even in free aether.
It may be remarked in passing that the term displacement,which was thus introduced, and which has been retainedinthe later development of the theory, is perhaps not well chosen; what in the early models of the aether was represented as anactual displacement, has in later investigations been conceivedof as a change of structure rather than of position in theelements of the aether. Maxwell supposed the electromotive' force acting on theelectric particles to be connected with the displacementDwhich accompanies it, by an equation of the form
where c, denotes a constant which depends on the elasticproperties of the cells. The displacement-current D mustnowbe inserted in the relation which connects the current withthe magnetic force ; and thus we obtain the equation
curl H = 47rS, where the vector S, which is called the total current, is thesum of the convection-current i and the displacement-currentD. By performing the operation div on both sides of thisequation, it is seen that the total current is a circuital vector.In the model, the total current is represented by the totalmotion of the rolling particles ; and this is conditioned bytherotations of the vortices in such a way as to imposethekinematic relation div S = 0. Having obtained the equations of motion of his systemof vortices and particles, Maxwell proceeded to determinetherate of propagation of disturbances through it. He consideredin particular the case in which the substance representedisadielectric, so that the conduction-current is zero. If, moreover,

equations may be written

Eliminating E, we see* that H satisfies the equations

But these are precisely the equations which the light-vector
satisfies in a medium in which the velocity of propagation is c^ : it follows that disturbances are propagated through the model
by waves which are similar to waves of light, the magnetic
(and similarly the electric) vector being in the wave-front.

The resultis that the energy per unit volume of the dielectric is fE/2/87r,where c denotes the specific inductive capacity of the dielectricand E' denotes the electric force, measured in terms of theelectrostatic unit : if E denotes the electric force expressedinterms of the electrodynamic units used in the present investi-gation, we have E = cE', where c denotes the constant which*occurs in transformations of this kind.

Thustheresult is obtained that the velocity of propagation of dis-turbances in Maxwell's medium is ce~, where denotesthespecific inductive capacity and c denotes the velocity for whichKohlrausch and Weber had foundf the value 3*1 x 1010 cm./sec.Now by this time the velocity of light was known, notonlyfrom the astronomical observations of aberration and of Jupiter'ssatellites, but also by direct terrestrial experiments. In 1849Hippolyte Louis FizeauJ had ' determined it by rotatingatoothed wheel so rapidly that a beam of light transmittedthrough the gap between two teeth and reflected back fromamirror was eclipsed by one of the teeth on its return journey.The velocity of light was calculated from the dimensionsandangular velocity of the wheel and the distance of the mirror;the result being 3*15 x 10 10 cm./sec.

| Comptes Rendus, xxix (1849), p. 90. A determination made by Cornuin1874 was on this principle. A different experimental method was employed in 1862 hy Leon Foucault(Comptes Rendus, Iv, pp. 501, 792) ; in this a ray from an origin was reflectedby a revolving mirror M to a fixed mirror, and so reflected back to J/, and againto O. It is evident that the returning ray ?dO must be deviated by twicetheangle through which M turns while the light passes from M to the fixed mirrorand back. The value thus obtained by Foucault for the velocity of light was
Maxwell. 283Maxwell was impressed, as Kirchhoff had been before him,
by the close agreement between the electric ratio c and the
velocity of light* ; and having demonstrated that the propagation of electric disturbance resembles that of light, he did not
hesitate to assert the identity of the two phenomena. "Wecan scarcely avoid the inference," he said,
" that light consists
in the transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena." Thus was answered
the question which Priestley had asked almost exactly a hundred
years before :f "Is there any electric fluid sui generis at all, distinct from the aether ? " The presence of the dielectric constant e in the expression
ct -i, which Maxwell had obtained for the velocity of propagation of electromagnetic disturbances, suggested a further test
of the identity of these disturbances with light: for the velocity
of light in a medium is known to be inversely proportional to the refractive index of the medium, and therefore the refractive index should be, according to the theory, proportional to the
square root of the specific inductive capacity. At the time,
however, Maxwell did not examine whether this relation was confirmed by experiment.
In what has preceded, the magnetic permeability //, has been
supposed to have the value unity. If this is not the case, the
2-98 x 10 10 cm./sec. Subsequent determinations by Michelson in 187'.) (Ast. Papers of the Amer. Ephemeris, i), and by Newcomb in 1882 (ibid., ii) depended
on the same principle. As was shown afterwards by Lord Rayleigh (Nature, xxiv, p. 382, xxv, p. 52) and by Gibbs (Nature, xxxiii, p. 582), the value obtained for the velocity of light by the methods of Fizeau and Foucault represents the group-velocity, not the wavevelocity ; the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites also give the group-velocity, while the value deduced from the coefficient of aberration is the wave- velocity. In a nondispersive medium, the group-velocity coincides with the wave- velocity ; and the agreement of the values of the velocity of light obtained by the two astronomical methods seems to negative the possibility of any appreciable dispersion in free aether. The velocity of light in dispersive media was directly investigated by Michelson
in 1883-4, with results in accordance with theory.

velocity of propagation of disturbance may be shown, bythesame analysis, to be ct~i^~i ; so that it is diminished when/u isgreater than unity, i.e., in paramagnetic bodies. This inferencehad been anticipated by Faraday : " Nor is it likely," he wrote,*" that the paramagnetic body oxygen can exist in the air andnot retard the transmission of the magnetism."
It was inevitable that a theory so novel and so capaciousasthat of Maxwell should involve conceptions which his contemporaries understood with difficulty and accepted with reluctance.Of these the most difficult and unacceptable was the principlethat the total current is always a circuital vector ; or, as itisgenerally expressed, that " all currents are closed." Accordingto the older electricians, a current which is employed in charginga condenser is not closed, but terminates at the coatings of thecondenser, where charges are accumulating. Maxwell, ontheother hand, taught that the dielectric between the coatingsis the seat of a process the displacement-current whichisproportional to the rate of increase of the electric force in thedielectric ; and that this process produces the same magneticeffects as a true current, and forms, so to speak, a continuation,through the dielectric, of the charging current, so that thelatter may be regarded as flowing in a closed circuit. Another characteristic feature of Maxwell's theory is theconception for which, as we have seen, he was largely indebtedto Faraday and Thomson that magnetic energy is the kineticenergy of a medium occupying the whole of space, andthatelectric energy is the energy of strain of the same medium.By this conception electromagnetic theory was brought intosuch close parallelism with the elastic- solid theories of theaether, that it was bound to issue in an electromagnetic theoryof light.
Maxwell's views were presented in a more developed formin a memoir entitled "A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field," which was read to the Koyal Society in 1864;f* Faraday's laboratory note-book for 1857 : of.

Maxwell. 285in this the architecture of his system was displayed, stripped of the scaffolding by aid of which it had been first erected. As the equations employed were for the most part the sameas had been set forth in the previous investigation, they need
only be briefly recapitulated. The magnetic induction juH, being
a circuital vector, may be expressed in terms of a vector-potential
A by the equation
luiK = curl A. The electric displacement D is connected with the volumedensity p
of free electric charge by the electrostatic equation
div D = p. The principle of conservation of electricity yields the equation
div i = -
dp/dt,
where i denotes the conduction-current.
The law of induction of currents namely, that the total electromotive force in any circuit is proportional to the rate of decrease of the number of lines of magnetic induction whichpass through it may be written - curl E = /LtH ; from which it follows that the electric force E must be expressible
in the form
E = - A + grad i//, where ^ denotes some scalar function. The quantities A and ;// which occur in this equation are not as yet completely deter- minate ; for the equation by which A is defined in terms of the
magnetic induction specifies only the circuital part of A ; and as the irrotational part of A is thus indeterminate, it is evident
that \p also must be indeterminate. Maxwell decided the matter
by assuming* A to be a circuital vector ; thus
divA = 0,
and therefore div E = -

286 Maxwell.
from which equation it is evident that ^ represents the electrostatic potential.
The principle which is peculiar to Maxwell's theory mustnow be introduced. Currents of conduction are not the onlykind of currents ; even in the older theory of Faraday, Thomson,and Mossotti, it had been assumed that electric chargesare set in motion in the particles of a dielectric whenthedielectric is subjected to an electric field ; and the predecessors of Maxwell would not have refused to admit thatthemotion of these charges is in some sense a current. Suppose,then, that S denotes the total current which is capableofgenerating a magnetic field : since the integral of the magneticforce round any curve is proportional to the electric currentwhich flows through the gap enclosed by the curve, we haveinsuitable units
curl H = 4;rS. In order to determine S, we may consider the case of a con-denser whose coatings are supplied with electricity byaconduction-current i per unit-area of coating. If o- denotethe surface-density of electric charge on the coatings, we havei = d(r/dt t and o- = D,
where D denotes the magnitude of the electric displacementDin the dielectric between the coatings ; so i = D. But sincethetotal current is to be circuital, its value in the dielectric mustbe the same as the value i which it has in the rest of thecircuit ; that is, the current in the dielectric has the valueD.We shall assume that the current in dielectrics always hasthisvalue, so that in the general equations the total current mustbe understood to be i + D. The above equations, together with those which expresstheproportionality of E to D in insulators, and to i in conductors,constituted Maxwell's system for a field formed by isotropicbodies which are not in motion. When the magnetic fieldis.due entirely to currents (including both conduction-currents
Maxwell. 287and displacement-currents), so that there is no magnetization, we have
V2 A = - curl curl A = - curl H
= - 47TS, so that the vector-potential is connected with the total current by an equation of the same form as that which connects the
scalar potential with the density of electric charge. To these
potentials Maxwell inclined to attribute a physical significance ; he supposed i// to be analogous to a pressure subsisting in the mass of particles in his model, and A to be the measure of the electrotonic state. The two functions are, however, of merely analytical interest, and do not correspond to physical
entities. For let two oppositely-charged conductors, placed
close to each other, give rise to an electrostatic field throughout
all space. In such a field the vector-potential A is everywherezero, while the scalar potential $ has a definite value at every
point. Now let these conductors discharge each other ; the
electrostatic force at any point of space remains unchangeduntil the point in question is reached by a wave of disturbance,
which is propagated outwards from the conductors with the
velocity of light, and which annihilates the field as it passes over it. But this order of events is not reflected in the
behaviour of Maxwell's functions ;// and A ; for at the instant
of discharge, ^ is everywhere annihilated, and A suddenly
acquires a finite value throughout all space. As the potentials do not possess any physical significance,
it is desirable to remove them from the equations. This wasafterwards done by Maxwell himself, who* in 1868- proposed
to base the electromagnetic theory of light solely on the
equations
curl H = 47rS, - curl E = B,
together with the equations which define S in terms of E, and Bin terms of H.

The memoir of 1864 contained an extension of the equationsto the case of bodies in motion ; the consideration of whichnaturally revives the question as to whether the aether is inany degree carried along with a body which moves throughit.Maxwell did not formulate any express doctrine on this subject;but his custom was to treat matter as if it were merelyamodification of the aether, distinguished only by alteredvalues of such constants as the magnetic permeability andthe specific inductive capacity ; so that his theory maybesaid to involve the assumption that matter and aether movetogether. In deriving the equations which are applicabletomoving bodies, he made use of Faraday's principle that theelectromotive force induced in a body depends only ontherelative motion of the body and the lines of magnetic force,whether one or the other is in motion absolutely. Fromthisprinciple it may be inferred that the equation which determinesthe electric force* in terms of the potentials, in the case ofabody which is moving with velocity w, is E = [w . /zH] - A + grad ^. Maxwell thought that the scalar quantity -fy in this equationrepresented the electrostatic potential; but the researchesofother investigators-)- have indicated that it represents the sumof the electrostatic potential and the quantity (A . w).
The electromagnetic theory of light was moreover extendedin this memoir so as to account for the optical propertiesofcrystals. For this purpose Maxwell assumed that in crystalsthe values of the coefficients of electric and magnetic inductiondepend on direction, so that the equation
fjbK = curl A
is replaced by
= curl A ; * It may be here remarked that later writers have distinguished betweentheelectric force in a moving body and the electric force in the aether through whichthe body is moving, and that E in the present equation corresponds to the formerof these vectors. t Helmholtz, Journ. fiir Math., Ixxviii (1874), p. 309; H. W. Watson, Phil.Mag. (5), xxv (1888), p. 271.
Maxwell. 289and similarly the equation
E = 47rcO>/6
is replaced by
E = 4;r (c?D.xt c?Dy, cjDz\
The other equations are the same as in isotropic media ; so that
the propagation of disturbance is readily seen to depend on the
equation
(/i J? ft.ffy, HZHZ} = - curl [c,
2 (curl 5),, tf(cuilH}y, Ca
2 (curl -#)*)
Now, if jui, ju 2 , A*3 are supposed equal to each other, this equation is the same as the equation of motion of MacCullagh's
aether in crystalline media,* the magnetic force H corresponding
to MacCullagh's elastic displacement ; and we may therefore
immediately infer that Maxwell's electromagnetic equations
yield a satisfactory theory of the propagation of light in
crystals, provided it is assumed that the magnetic permeability
is (for optical purposes) the same in all directions, and provided the plane of polarization is identified with the plane
which contains the magnetic vector. It is readily shown that
the direction of the ray is at right angles to the magnetic
vector and the electric force, and that the wave-front is the
plane of the magnetic vector and the electric displacement.f
After this Maxwell proceeded to investigate the propagation
of light in metals. The difference between metals and dielectrics, so far as electricity is concerned, is that the former are con- ductors ; and it was therefore natural to seek the cause of the
optical properties of metals in their ohmic conductivity. This
idea at once suggested a physical reason for the opacity of metals namely, that within a metal the energy of the light
vibrations is converted into Joulian heat in the same way as the energy of ordinary electric currents.
* Cf. pp. 154 et sqq. f In the memoir of 1864 Maxwell left open the choice between the above theory and that which is obtained by assuming that in crystals the specific inductive
rapacity is (for optical purposes) the same in all directions, while the magnetic
permeability is aeolotropic. In the latcer case the plane of polarization must be
identified with the plane which contains the electric displacement. Nine years
later, in his Treatise ( 794), Maxwell definitely adopted the former alternative. U

The equations of the electromagnetic field in the metalmaybe written
curl H = 47rS, - curl E = H,
S = i + D = KE + where K denotes the ohmic conductivity ; whence it is seenthatthe electric force satisfies the equation
=c2 V2E. This is of the same form as the corresponding equationinthe elastic-solid theory* ; and, like it, furnishes a satisfactorygeneral explanation of metallic reflexion. It is indeed correctin all details, so long as the period of the disturbance is nottooshort i.e., so long as the light- waves considered belong totheextreme infra-red region of the spectrum ; but if we attempttoapply the theory to the case of ordinary light, we are confrontedby the difficulty which Lord Eayleigh indicated in the elastic-solid theory,f and which attends all attempts to explainthepeculiar properties of metals by inserting a viscous terminthe equation. The difficulty is that, in order to account fortheproperties of ideal silver, we must suppose the coefficientofE negative that is, the dielectric constant of the metal mustbe negative, which would imply instability of electricalequilibrium in the metal. The problem, as we have alreadyremarked,:}: was solved only when its relation to the theoryofdispersion was rightly understood.
At this time important developments were in progressinthe last-named subject. Since the time of Fresnel, theoriesofdispersion had proceeded! from the assumption that the radiiof action of the particles of luminiferous media are so largeas to be comparable with the wave-length of light. It wasgenerally supposed that the aether is loaded by the molecules* Cf. p. iso. t Cf. p. 181. Cf. also Rayleigh, Phil. Mag. (5) xii (1881), p. 81, andH. A.

Maxwell. 291of ponderable matter, and that the amount of dispersion
depends on the ratio of the wave-length to the distance
between adjacent molecules. This hypothesis was, however,
seen to be inadequate, when, in 1862, F. P. Leroux* found that
a prism filled with the vapour of iodine refracted the red rays
to a greater degree than the blue rays; for in all theories
which depend on the assumption of a coarse-grained luminiferous medium, the refractive index increases with the frequency
of the light.
Leroux's phenomenon, to which the name anomalous dis- persion was given, was shown by later investigators-)- to be
generally associated with " surface-colour." i.e., the property of
brilliantly reflecting incident light of some particular frequency.
Such an association seemed to indicate that the dispersive
property of a substance is intimately connected with a certain
frequency of vibration which is peculiar to that substance, andwhich, when it happens to fall within the limits of the visible spectrum, is apparent in the surface-colour. This idea of a
frequency of vibration peculiar to each kind of ponderablematter is found in the writings of Stokes as far back as the
year 1852 ; when, discussing fluorescence, he remarked:
" Nothing seems more natural than to suppose that the incident
vibrations of the luminiferous aether produce vibratory movements among the ultimate molecules of sensitive substances,
and that the molecules in turn, swinging on their own account,
produce vibrations in the luminiferous aether, and thus cause
the sensation of light. The periodic times of these vibrations
depend on the periods in which the molecules are disposed to swing, not upon the periodic time of the incident vibrations." The principle here introduced, of considering the molecules
as dynamical systems which possess natural free periods, andwhich interact with the incident vibrations, lies at the basis of

all modern theories of dispersion. The earliest of these wasdevised by Maxwell, who, in the Cambridge Mathematical Triposfor 1869,* published the results of the following investigation: A model of a dispersive medium may be constituted byembedding systems which represent the atoms of ponderablematter in a medium which represents the aether. Wemaypicture each atomj- as composed of a single massive particlesupported symmetrically by springs from the interior faceofa massless spherical shell : if the shell be fixed, the particlewill be capable of executing vibrations about the centre of thesphere, the effect of the springs being equivalent to a forceonthe particle proportional to its distance from the centre. Theatoms thus constituted may be supposed to occupy smallspherical cavities in the aether, the outer shell of each atombeing in contact with the aether at all points and partakingof its motion. An immense number of atoms is supposedtoexist in each unit volume of the dispersive medium, so thatthe medium as a whole is fine-grained.
Suppose that the potential energy of strain of free aetherper unit volume is

equation gives approximately ju

The dispersion of light within the limits of the visiblespectrum is for most substances controlled by a naturalfrequency p which corresponds to a vibration beyond the violetend of the visible spectrum : so that, n being smaller thanp,we may expand the fraction in the formula of dispersion, andobtain the equation

which resembles the formula of dispersion in Cauchy's theory*; indeed, we may say that Cauchy's formula is the expansionofMaxwell's formula in a series which, as it converges only whenn has values within a limited range, fails to represent thephenomena outside that range. The theory as given above is defective in that it becomesmeaningless when the frequency n of the incident light isequal to the frequency p of the free vibrations of the atoms.This defect may be remedied by supposing that the motionofan atomic particle relative to the shell in which it is containedis opposed by a dissipative force varying as the relativevelocity ; such a force suffices to prevent the forced vibrationfrom becoming indefinitely great as the period of the incidentlight approaches the period of free vibration of the atoms; itsintroduction is justified by the fact that vibrations in thispart of the spectrum suffer absorption in passing through themedium. When the incident vibration is not in the sameregion of the spectrum as the free vibration, the absorptionisnot of much importance, and may be neglected.
It is shown by the spectroscope that the atomic systemswhich emit and absorb radiation in actual bodies possess morethan one distinct free period. The theory already given may,however, readily be extended-)- to the case in which the atomshave several natural frequencies of vibration ; we have onlytosuppose that the external massless rigid shell is connectedbysprings to an interior massive rigid shell, and that this again* Cf. p. 183. t This subject was developed by Lord Kelvin in the' Baltimore Lectures.
Maxwell. 295is connected by springs to another massive shell inside it, and
so on. The corresponding extension of the equation for the
refractive index is

The validity of the Maxwell- Sellmeier formula of dispersion was strikingly confirmed by experimental researches in the closing years of the nineteenth century. In 1897 Rubens*showed that the formula represents closely the refractive
indices of sylvin (potassium chloride) and rock-salt, with
respect to light and radiant heat of wave-lengths between4,240 A.U. and 223,000 A.U. The constants in the formula
being known from this comparison, it was possible to predict
the dispersion for radiations of still lower frequency ; and it was found that the square of the refractive index should havea negative value (indicating complete reflexion) for wavelengths 370,000 A.U. to 550,000 A.U. in the case of rock-salt,
and for wave-lengths 450,000 ^to 670,000 A.U. in the case of sylvin. This inference was verified experimentally in the
following year.f
It may seem strange that Maxwell, having successfully
employed his electromagnetic theory to explain the propagation
of light in isotropic media, in crystals, and in metals, should
have omitted to apply it to the problem of reflexion and refraction. This is all the more surprising, as the study of the optics
of crystals had already revealed a close analogy between the
electromagnetic theory and MacCullagh's elastic-solid theory;
and in order to explain reflexion and refraction electro- magnetically, nothing more was necessary than to transcribe
MacCullagh's investigation of the same problem, interpreting e (the time-flux of the displacement of MacCullagh's aether) as the magnetic force, and curl e as the electric displacement. As* Ann. d. Phys. Ix (1897), p. 454. t Rubens and Aschkinass, Ann. d. Phys. Ixiv (1898).
296 Maxwell.
in MacCullagh's theory the difference between the contiguousmedia is represented by a difference of their elastic constants,so in the electromagnetic theory it may be represented byadifference in their specific inductive capacities. From a letterwhich Maxwell wrote to Stokes in 1864, and which has beenpreserved,* it appears that the problem of reflexion and refrac-tion was engaging Maxwell's attention at the time when he waspreparing his Eoyal Society memoir on the electromagneticfield; but he was not able to satisfy himself regarding theconditions which should be satisfied at the interface betweenthe media. He seems to have been in doubt which of the rivalelastic-solid theories to take as a pattern ; and it is not unlikelythat he was led astray by relying too much on the analogybetween the electric displacement and an elastic displacement.tFor in the elastic-solid theory all three components of the dis-placement must be continuous across the interface between twocontiguous media ; but Maxwell found that it was impossibletoexplain reflexion and refraction if all three components of theelectric displacement were supposed to be continuous across theinterface ; and, unwilling to give up the analogy which hadhitherto guided him aright, yet unable to disprove^ the Greenianconditions at bounding surfaces, he seems to have laid aside theproblem until some new light should dawn upon it. This was not the only difficulty which beset the electro-magnetic theory. The theoretical conclusion, that the specificinductive capacity of a medium should be equal to the squareofits refractive index with respect to waves of long period, wasnot as yet substantiated by experiment; and the theory ofdisplacement-currents, on which everything else depended, was* Stokes's Scientific Correspondence, ii, pp. 25, 26. t It must be remembered tbat Maxwell pictured tbe electric displacement as areal displacement of a medium. "My theory of electrical forces," he \vrote, "isthat they are called into play in insulating media by slight electric displacements,which put certain small portions of the medium into a state of distortion, which,being resisted by the elasticity of the medium, produces an electromotive force."Campbell and Garnett's Life of Maxwell, p. 244.

contemporaries. Helmholtz indeed ultimately accepted it, but
only after many years ; and W. Thomson (Kelvin) seems never
to have thoroughly believed it to the end of his long life. In
1888 he referred to it as a "curious and ingenious, but not
wholly tenable hypothesis,"* and proposedf to replace it by an
extension of the older potential theories. In 1896 he had someinclination? to speculate that alterations of electrostatic force due to rapidly-changing electrification are propagated by condensational waves in the luminiferous aether. In 1904 he
admittedg that a bar-magnet rotating about an axis at right
angles to its length is equivalent to a lamp emitting light of period equal to the period of the rotation, but gave his final judgment in the sentence|| : " The so-called electromagnetic
theory of light has not helped us hitherto." Thomson appears to have based his ideas of the propagation
of electric disturbance on the case which had first becomefamiliar to him that of the transmission of signals along a
wire. He clung to the older view that in such a disturbance
the wire is the actual medium of transmission ; whereas in \ Maxwell's theory the function of the wire is merely to guide
the disturbance, which is resident in the surrounding dielectric. This opinion that conductors are the media of propagation
of electric disturbance was entertained also by Ludwig Lorenz
(&. 1829, d. 1891), of Copenhagen, who independently developed an electromagnetic theory of lightH a few years after the
publication of Maxwell's memoirs. The procedure which
Lorenz followed was that which Kiemann had suggested** in 1858 namely, to modify the accepted formulae of electro- dynamics by introducing terms which, though too small to be

Thus the values of thepotentials at (x, y, z] at any instant t would, accordingtoLorenz's theory, depend on the electric state at the point(x', y', z') at the previous instant (t -

The equations (I), (II), (III) are, however, the fundamental
equations of Maxwell's theory; and therefore the theory of
L. Lorenz is practically equivalent to that of Maxwell, so far as concerns the propagation of electromagnetic disturbances
through free aether. Lorenz himself, however, does not appear
to have clearly perceived this ; for in his memoir he postulated
the presence of conducting matter throughout space, and was
consequently led to equations resembling those which Maxwellhad given for the propagation of light in metals. Observing
that his equations represented periodic electric currents at
right angles to the direction of propagation of the disturbance,
he suggested that all luminous vibrations might be constituted
by electric currents, and hence that there was
" no longer anyreason for maintaining the hypothesis of an aether, since wecan admit that space contains sufficient ponderable matter to enable the disturbance to be propagated."

the rich physical suggestiveness of Maxwell's ; the valueofhis memoir lies chiefly in the introduction of the retardedpotentials. It may be remarked in passing that Lorenz'sretarded potentials are not identical with Maxwell's scalarand vector potentials ; for Lorenz's a is not a circuital vector,and Lorenz's < is not, like Maxwell's, the electrostatic potential,but depends on the positions occupied by the charges at certainprevious instants. For some years no progress was made either with Maxwell'stheory or with Lorenz's. Meanwhile, Maxwell had in 1865resigned his chair at King's College, and had retired to hisestate in Dumfriesshire, where he occupied himself in writinga connected account of electrical theory. In 1871 he returnedto Cambridge as Professor of Experimental Physics; andtwoyears later published his Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism.In this celebrated work is comprehended almost everybranch of electric and magnetic theory; but the intentionofthe writer was to discuss the whole as far as possible fromasingle point of view, namely, that of Faraday; so that littleor no account was given of the hypotheses which had beenpropounded in the two preceding decades by the great Germanelectricians. So far as Maxwell's purpose was to disseminatethe ideas of Faraday, it was undoubtedly fulfilled ; buttheTreatise was less successful when considered as the expositionof its author's own views. The doctrines peculiar to Maxwellthe existence of displacement-currents, and of electromagneticvibrations identical with light were not introduced in the first'volume, or in the first half of the second volume ; andtheaccount which was given of them was scarcely more complete,and was perhaps less attractive, than that which had beenfurnished in the original memoirs.
Some matters were, however, discussed more fully in theTreatise than in Maxwell's previous writings ; and amongthesewas the question of stress in the electromagnetic field. It will be remembered* that Faraday, when studyingthe* Cf. p. 209.
Maxwell. 301
curvature of lines of force in electrostatic fields, had noticed an apparent tendency of adjacent lines to repel each other, as
if each tube of force were inherently disposed to distend
laterally ; and that in addition to this repellent or diverging
force in the transverse direction, he supposed an attractive or
contractile force to be exerted at right angles to it, that is to
say, in the direction of the lines of force. Of the existence of these pressures and tensions Maxwell
was fully persuaded ; and he determined analytical expressions
suitable to represent them. The tension along the lines of
force must be supposed to maintain the ponderomotive force
which acts on the conductor on which the lines of force
terminate ; and it may therefore be measured by the force which is exerted on unit area of the conductor, i.e., *E2/87rc
2 or iDE. The pressure at right angles to the lines of force must
then be determined so as to satisfy the condition that the aether
is to be in equilibrium.
For this purpose, consider a thin shell of aether included
between two equipotential surfaces. The equilibrium of the,
portion of this shell which is intercepted by a tube of force- requires (as in the theory of the equilibrium of liquid films),
that the resultant force per unit area due to the abovementioned normal tensions on its two faces shall have the- value T(l/pi + l//o2), where pi and pz denote the principal radii
of curvature of the shell at the place, and where T denotes,
the lateral stress across unit length of the surface of the shell,, T being analogous to the surface-tension of a liquid film. Now, if t denote the thickness of the shell, the area inter- cepted on the second face by the tube of force bears to the
area intercepted on the first face the ratio (pi + t) (pz + t)/p!p2 > and by the fundamental property of tubes of force, D and Evary inversely as the cross-section of the tube, so the total force on the second face will bear to that on the first face the ratio piptKpi + 1} (pz + 1), or approximately

the resultant force per unit area along the outward normalistherefore - IDE . t . (l//t>i + I//*),
and so we have
T = - IDE . t ; or the pressure at right angles to the lines of force is |DEperunit area that is, it is numerically equal to the tension alongthe lines of force. The principal stresses in the medium being thus determined,it readily follows that the stress across any plane, to whichtheunit vector N is normal, is (D.N)E-i(D - E) N- Maxwell obtained* a similar formula for the case of magneticfields ; the ponderornotive forces on magnetized matter andonconductors carrying currents may be accounted for by assuminga stress in the medium, the stress across the plane N" beingrepresented by the vector 1(B.K).H-1(B .H).N.
;jThis, like the corresponding electrostatic formula, representsatension across planes perpendicular to the lines of force, andapressure across planes parallel to them.
It may be remarked that Maxwell made no distinctionbetween stress in the material dielectric and stress intheaether : indeed, so long as it was supposed that material bodieswhen displaced carry the contained aether along with them,no distinction was possible. In the modifications of Maxwell'stheory which were developed many years afterwards byhisfollowers, stresses corresponding to those introduced by Maxwellwere assigned to the aether, as distinct from ponderable matter;and it was assumed that the only stresses set up in materialbodies by the electromagnetic field are produced indirectly:they may be calculated by the methods of the theoryofelasticity, from a knowledge of the ponderomotive forcesexerted on the electric charges connected with the bodies.
* Maxwell's Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, 643.
Maxwell. 303Another remark suggested by Maxwell's theory of stress in the medium is that he considered the question from the
purely statical point of view. He determined the stress so that
it might produce the required forces on ponderable bodies, and
be self-equilibrating in free aether. But* if the electric and
magnetic phenomena are not really statical, but are kinetic in
their nature, the stress or pressure need not be self-equilibrating.
This may be illustrated by reference to the hydrodynamical
models of the aether shortly to be described, in which perforated
solids are immersed in a moving liquid : the ponderomotive
forces exerted on the solids by the liquid correspond to those
which act on conductors carrying currents in a magnetic field, and yet there is no stress in the medium beyond the pressure
of the liquid.
Among the problems to which Maxwell applied his theory
of stress in the medium was one which had engaged the
attention of many generations of his predecessors. The adherents of the corpuscular theory of light in the eighteenth
century believed that their hypothesis would be decisively con- firmed if it could be shown that rays of light possess momentum: to determine the matter, several investigators directed powerful
beams of light on delicately-suspended bodies, and looked for evidences of a pressure due to the impulse of the corpuscles.
Such an experiment was performed in 1708 by Homberg,f whoimagined that he actually obtained the effect in question ; but
Mairan and Du Fay in the middle of the century, having
repeated his operations, failed to confirm his conclusion.*
The subject was afterwards taken up by Michell, who "someyears ago," wrote Priestley in 1772,
" endeavoured to ascertain
the momentum of light in a much more accurate manner than
those in which M. Homberg and M. Mairan had attempted it." He exposed a very thin and delicately-suspended copper plate

to the rays of the sun concentrated by a mirror, and observeda deflexion. He was not satisfied that the effect of the heatingof the air had been altogether excluded, but " there seemstobe no doubt," in Priestley's opinion,
" but that the motion abovementioned is to be ascribed to the impulse of the rays of light."A similar experiment was made by A. Bennet,* who directedthe light from the focus of a large lens on writing-paperdelicately suspended in an exhausted receiver, but " could notperceive any motion distinguishable from the effects of heat."" Perhaps," he concluded,
" sensible heat and light may notbecaused by the influx or rectilineal projections of fine particles,but by the vibrations made in the universally diffused caloricor matter of heat, or fluid of light." Thus Bennet, and afterhim Young,f regarded the non-appearance of light- repulsioninthis experiment as an argument in favour of the undulatorysystem of light. " For," wrote Young,
" granting the utmostimaginable subtility of the corpuscles of light, their effectsmight naturally be expected to bear some proportion to theeffects of the much less rapid motions of the electrical fluid,which are so very easily perceptible, even in their weakeststates." This attitude is all the more remarkable, because Eulermany years before had expressed the opinion that light-pressuremight be expected just as reasonably on the undulatory 'as onthe corpuscular hypothesis. "Just as," he wrote,J "a vehementsound excites not only a vibratory motion in the particlesofthe air, but there is also observed a real movement of the smallparticles of dust which are suspended therein, it is not tobedoubted but that the vibratory motion set up by the lightcauses a similar effect." Euler not only inferred the existenceof light-pressure, but even (adopting a suggestion of Kepler's)accounted for the tails of comets by supposing that the solarrays, impinging on the atmosphere of a comet, drive off fromit the more subtle of its particles.

Maxwell. 305
The question was examined by Maxwell* from the point
of view of the electromagnetic theory of light ; which readily
furnishes reasons for the existence of light-pressure. For
suppose that light falls on a metallic reflecting surface at perpendicular incidence. The light may be regarded as constituted of a rapidly-alternating magnetic field ; and this must
induce electric currents in the surface layers of the metal. But
a metal carrying currents in a magnetic field is acted on by a ponderomotive force, which is at right angles to both the
magnetic force and the direction of the current, and is therefore, in the present case, normal to the reflecting surface : this ponderomotive force is the light-pressure. Thus, according
to Maxwell's theory, light-pressure is only an extended case of
effects which may readily be produced in the laboratory.
The magnitude of the light-pressure was deduced by
Maxwell from his theory of stresses in the medium. We have
seen that the stress across a plane whose unit-normal is N is represented by the vector (D . N) . E -
J (D . E) . N + (B . N) . H - ~ (B . H) . N.
47T O7T Now, suppose that a plane wave is incident perpendicularly on
a perfectly reflecting metallic sheet: this sheet must support
the mechanical stress which exists at its boundary in the
aether. Owing to the presence of the reflected wave, D is zero
at the surface ; and B is perpendicular to N, so (B . N) vanishes.
Thus the stress is a pressure of magnitude (l/8?r) (B . H)
normal to the surface : that is, the light-pressure is equal to the density of the aethereal energy in the region immediately
outside the metal. This was Maxwell's result. This conclusion has been reached on the assumption that
the light is incident normally to the reflecting surface. If, on
the other hand, the surface is placed in an enclosure completely
surrounded by a radiating shell, so that radiation falls on it from all directions, it may be shown that the light-pressure is measured by one-third of the density of aethereal energy.
* Maxwell's Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, 792. X
306 Maxwell.
A different way of inferring the necessity for light-pressurewas indicated in 1876 by A. Bartoli,* who showed that, whenradiant energy is transported from a cold body to a hot onebymeans of a moving mirror, the second law of thermodynamicswould be violated unless a pressure were exerted on the mirrorby the light.
The thermodynamical ideas introduced into the subjectbyBartoli have proved very fruitful. If a hollow vessel be atadefinite temperature, the aether within the vessel must befullof radiation crossing from one side to the other : and hencetheaether, when in radiative equilibrium with matter at a giventemperature, is the seat of a definite quantity of energyperunit volume.
If U denote this energy per unit volume, and P the lightpressure on unit area of a surface exposed to the radiation,wemay applyf the equation of available energy!
U-T dF
~ 1 P
dT
Since, as we have seen,
this equation gives . dU
dT'
and therefore U must be proportional to T*. From this it maybe inferred that the intensity of emission of radiant energybya body at temperature T is proportional to the fourth powerofthe absolute temperature a law which was first discoveredexperimentally by Stefan in 1879.
In the year in which Maxwell's treatise was published,Sir William Crookes|| obtained experimental evidence ofapressure accompanying the incidence of light; but this was*

soon found to be due to thermal effects ; and the existence of a true light-pressure was not confirmed experimentally* until 1899. Since then the subject has been considerably developed,
especially in regard to the part played by the pressure of radiation
in cosmical physics.
Another matter which received attention in Maxwell's
Treatise was the influence of a magnetic field on the propagation
of light in material substances. We have already seenf that
the theory of magnetic vortices had its origin in Thomson's
speculations on this phenomenon ; and Maxwell in his memoir
of 1861-2 had attempted by the help of that theory to arrive
at some explanation of it. The more complete investigation
which is given in the Treatise is based on the same general
assumptions, namely, that in a medium subjected to a magnetic
field there exist concealed vortical motions, the axes of the
vortices being in the direction of the lines of magnetic force ; and that waves of light passing through the medium disturb
the vortices, which thereupon react dynamically on the luminous
motion, and so affect its velocity of propagation.
The manner of this dynamical interaction must now be more closely examined. Maxwell supposed that the magnetic
vortices are affected by the light-waves in the same way as vortex-filaments in a liquid would be affected by any other
coexisting motion in the liquid. The latter problem had been
already discussed in Helrnholtz'js great memoir on vortex- motion ; adopting Helmholtz's results, Maxwell assumed for the
additional term introduced into the magnetic force by the dis- placement of the vortices the value 9e/B0, where e denotes the
displacement of the medium (i.e. the light vector), and the
operator d/dO denotes H^/dx + Hy'dj^y + Hzd/dz, H denoting the
imposed magnetic field. Thus the luminous motion, by dis- turbing the vortices, gives rise to an electric current in the
medium, proportional to curl *P. Lebedew, Archives des Sciences Phys. et Nat. (4) viii (1899), p. 184. Ann. d. Phys. vi (1901), p. 433. E. F. Nichols and G. F. Hull, Phys. Rev.

Maxwell further assumed that the current thus producedinteracts dynamically with the luminous motion in suchamanner that the kinetic energy of the medium containsaterm proportional to the scalar product of e and curl de/30.The total kinetic energy of the medium may therefore bewritten
\p& + Jcr (e . curl 9e/a0),
where p
denotes the density of the medium, and cr denotesaconstant which measures the capacity of the medium to rotatethe plane of polarization of light in a magnetic field. The equation of motion may now be derived as in theelastic- solid theories of light : it is

rise to different theories of reflexion. The assumptions involved in Maxwell's treatment of the
magnetic rotation of light were such as might scarcely be
justified in themselves ; but since the discussion as a whole
proceeded from sound dynamical principles, and its conclusions were in harmony with experimental results, it was fitted to lead to the more perfect explanations which were afterwards
devised by his successors. At the time of Maxwell's death,
which happened in 1879, before he had completed his fortyninth year, much yet remained to be done both in this and in the other investigations with which his name is associated;
and the energies of the next generation were largely spent in extending and refining that conception of electrical and optical
phenomena whose origin is correctly indicated in its name of Maxwell's Theory.

MODELS OF THE AETHER.
THE early attempts of Thomson and Maxwell to represent theelectric medium by mechanical models opened up a new fieldofresearch, to which investigators were attracted as much byitsintrinsic fascination as by the importance of the services whichit promised to render to electric theory.
Of the models to which reference has already been made,some such as those described in Thomson's memoir* of 1847and Maxwell's memoirf of 1861-2 attribute a linear characterto electric force and electric current, and a rotatory characterto magnetism; others such as that devised by Maxwellin1855J and afterwards amplified by Helmholtz regard magnetic force as a linear and electric current as a rotatoryphenomenon. This distinction furnishes a natural classificationof models into two principal groups.
Even within the limits of the former group diversityhasalready become apparent ; for in Maxwell's analogy of 1861-2,a continuous vortical motion is supposed to be in progress aboutthe lines of magnetic induction ; whereas in Thomson's analogythe vector-potential was likened to the displacement inanelastic solid, so that the magnetic induction at any point wouldbe represented by the twist of an element of volume of thesolid from its equilibrium position ; or, in symbols,
a = e, E = - e, B = curl e, where a denotes the vector-potential, E the electric force, Bthemagnetic induction, and e the elastic displacement.

Models of the Aether. 311in his model a linear current could be represented by a piece
of endless, cord, of the same quality as the solid and embeddedin it, if a tangential force were applied to the cord uniformly
all round the circuit. The forces so applied tangentially pro- duce a tangential drag on the surrounding solid ; and the
rotatory displacement thus caused is everywhere proportional
to the magnetic vector. In order to represent the effect of varying permeability,
Thomson abandoned the ordinary type of elastic solid, andreplaced it by an aether of MacCullagh^s type; that is to say, an ideal incompressible substance, having no rigidity of the
ordinary kind (i.e. elastic resistance to change of shape), butcapable of resisting absolute rotation a property to which the name gyrostatic rigidity was given. The rotation of the solid representing the magnetic induction, and the coefficient of gyrostatic rigidity being inversely proportional to the permeability, the normal component of magnetic induction will be
continuous across an interface, as it should be.* We have seen above that in models of this kind the electric force is represented by the translatory velocity of the medium.It might therefore be expected that a strong electric field wouldperceptibly affect the velocity of propagation of light ; and that
this does not appear to be the case,f is an argument against the
validity of the scheme.
We now turn to the alternative conception, in which electric phenomena are regarded as rotatory, and magnetic force is represented by the linear velocity of the medium; in symbols,
4-TrD = curl e, H = e, where D denotes the electric displacement, H the magnetic
force, and e the displacement of the medium. In Maxwell's
memoir of 1855, and in most of the succeeding writings for
* Thomson inclined to believe (Papers, iii, p. I&5) that light might he correctly represented by the vibratory motion of such a solid. t Wilberforce, Trans. Camb. Phil. Soc. xiv (1887), p. 170 ; Lodge, Phil. Trans, clxxxix (1897), p. 149.
312 Models of the Aether.
many years, attention was directed chiefly to magnetic fields ofa steady, or at any rate non-oscillatory, character ; in such fields,the motion of the particles of the medium is continuouslyprogressive ; and it was consequently natural to suppose themedium to be fluid. Maxwell himself, as we have seen,* afterwards abandonedthis conception in favour of that which represents magneticphenomena as rotatory. "According to Ampere and all hisfollowers," he wrote in 1870,f
" electric currents are regardedas a species of translation, and magnetic force as dependingonrotation. I am constrained to agree with this view, becausethe electric current is associated with electrolysis, and otherundoubted instances of translation, while magnetism is asso-ciated with the rotation of the plane of polarization of light."But the other analogy was felt to be too valuable to bealtogether discarded, especially when in 1858 Helmholtzextended itj by showing that if magnetic induction is compared to fluid velocity, then electric currents correspondtovortex-filaments in the fluid. Two years afterwards Kirchhoffdeveloped it further. If the analogy has any dynamical (asdistinguished from a merely kinematical) value, it is evident thatthe ponderomotive forces between metallic rings carrying electriccurrents should be similar to the ponderomotive forces betweenthe same rings when they are immersed in an infinite incompressible fluid; the motion of the fluid being such that itscirculation through the aperture of each ring is proportional tothe strength of the electric current in the corresponding ring.In order to decide the question, Kirchhoff attempted, and solved,the hydrodynamical problem of the motion of two thin, rigidrings in an incompressible frictionless fluid, the fluid motionbeing irrotational ; and found that the forces between the ringsare numerically equal to those which the rings would exert on* Cf. p. 276. t Proc.

each other if they were traversed by electric currents pro- portional to the circulations. There is, however, an important difference between the two
cases, which was subsequently discussed by W. Thomson, whopursued the analogy in several memoirs.* In order to represent
the magnetic field by a conservative dynamical system, we shall suppose that it is produced by a number of rings of perfectly
conducting material, in which electric currents are circulating ; the surrounding medium being free aether. Now any perfectly
conducting body acts as an impenetrable barrier to lines of magnetic force ; for, as Maxwell showed,f when a perfect con- ductor is placed in a magnetic field, electric currents are induced on its surface in such a way as to make the total magnetic force zero throughout the interior of the conductor.^ Lines of force are thus deflected by the body in the same way as the lines of flow of an incompressible fluid would be deflected by an obstacle
of the same form, or as the lines of flow of electric current in a uniform conducting mass would be deflected by the introduction
of a body of this form and of infinite resistance. If, then, for simplicity we consider two perfectly conducting rings carrying
currents, those lines of force which are initially linked with a
ring cannot escape from their entanglement, and new lines cannot become involved in it. This implies that the total number of lines of magnetic force which pass through the
aperture of each ring is invariable. If the coefficients of self and mutual induction of the rings are denoted by Z,, Z2, Z12, the electrokinetic energy of the system may be represented by
T = J (Z,*V + 2Z12 ^ + Z2 v),
where i\, i> denote the strengths of the currents; and the
condition that the number of lines of force linked with each
circuit is to be invariable gives the equations
Liii + Z12 i2 = constant,
Lz iz = constant.

It is evident that, when the system is considered fromthepoint of view of general dynamics, the electric currents mustberegarded as generalized velocities, and the quantities
(L1 i1 + Z, 2 i2) and (Z12 ^ + L9 i2 ) as momenta. The electromagnetic ponderomotive force ontherings tending to increase any coordinate x is dT/dv. Intheanalogous hydrodynamical system, the fluid velocity correspondsto the magnetic force: and therefore the circulation througheach ring (which is defined to be the integral fvds, taken rounda path linked once with the ring) corresponds kinematicallytothe electric current ; and the flux of fluid through each ringcorresponds to the number of lines of magnetic force whichpass through the aperture of the ring. But in the hydrodynamical problem the circulations play the part of generalizedmomenta ; while the fluxes of fluid through the rings playthepart of generalized velocities. The kinetic energy may indeedbe expressed in the form
where KI, c2, denote the circulations (so that KI and c2 areproportional respectively to ^ and 4), and NI, Nn, N2 , dependon the positions of the rings ; but this is the Hamiltonian(asopposed to the Lagrangian) form of the energy-function,*andthe ponderomotive force on the rings tending to increaseany coordinate x is - dK/dx. Since dK/dx is equal to dT/dx,we see that the ponderomotive forces on the rings in anyposition in the hydrodynamical system are equal, but opposite,to the ponderomotive forces on the rings in the electricsystem.
The reason for the difference between the two cases mayreadily be understood. The rings cannot cut through the linesof magnetic force in the one system, but they can cut throughthe stream-lines in the other : consequently the flux of fluidthrough the rings is not invariable when the rings are moved,theinvariants in the hydrodynamical system being the circulations.* Cf. Whittaker, Analytical Dynamics, 109.
Modds of the Aethtr. 315If a thin ring, for which the circulation is zero, is introduced
into the fluid, it will experience no ponderomotive forces ; but
if a ring initially carrying no current is introduced into amagnetic field, it will experience ponderomotive forces, owing
to the electric currents induced in it by its motion,
Imperfect though the analogy is, it is not without interest. Abar-magnet, being equivalent to a current circulating in a wire
wound round it, may be compared (as W. Thomson remarked)
to a straight tube immersed in a perfect fluid, the fluid entering
at one end and flowing out by the other, so that the particles
of fluid follow the lines of magnetic force. If two such tubes
are presented with like ends to each other, they attract ; with
unlike ends, they repeL The forces are thus diametrically
opposite in direction to those of magnets ; but in other respects
the laws of mutual action between these tubes and between
magnets are precisely the same.*
* The mathematical analysis in this ease is very simple. Anarrowrube through which water is flowing may be regarded as equivalent to a source at one end of the tube and a sink at the other; and the problem may therefore be reduced to the
consideration of sinks in an unlimited fluid, If there are two sinks in sneh a fluid, of strengths m and */, the Telocity-potential is at/r + m*//, where r and i" denote distance from the sinks. The kinetic energy per unit

Thomson, moreover, investigated* the ponderomotive forceswhich act between two solid bodies immersed in a fluid, whenone of the bodies is constrained to perform small oscillations.If, for example, a small sphere immersed in an incompressiblefluid is compelled to oscillate along the line which joinsitscentre to that of a much larger sphere, which is free, thefreesphere will be attracted if it is denser than the fluid ; whileif it is less dense than the fluid, it will be repelled or attractedaccording as the ratio of its distance from the vibrator toitsradius is greater or less than a certain quantity dependingonthe ratio of its density to the density of the fluid. Systemsof this kind were afterwards extensively investigatedbyC. A. Bjerknes.f Bjerknes showed that two spheres whichare immersed in an incompressible fluid, and which pulsate(i.e., change in volume) regularly, exert on each other (bythemediation of the fluid) an attraction, determined by the inversesquare law, if the pulsations are concordant ; and exertoneach other a repulsion, determined likewise by the inversesquare law, if the phases of the pulsations differ by halfaperiod. It is necessary to suppose that the medium is incompressible, so that all pulsations are propagated instantaneously:otherwise attractions would change to repulsions and vice versaat distances greater than a quarter wave-length.^ If thespheres, instead of pulsating, oscillate to and fro in straightlines about their mean positions, the forces between themareproportional in magnitude and the same in direction, butmutual distance I than when sinks of the same strengths are at infinite distanceapart by an amount lirpmm'/l. Since, in the case of the tubes, the quantitiesmcorrespond to the fluxes of fluid, this expression corresponds to the Lagrangianform of the kinetic energy ; and therefore the force tending to increase the coordi-nate x of one of the sinks is (3/9#) (4ny> ww'/Z).

opposite in sign, to those which act between two magnets
oriented along the directions of oscillation.* The results obtained by Bjerknes were extended by
A. H. Leahyf to the case of two spheres pulsating in an
elastic medium ; the wave-length of the disturbance being
supposed large in comparison with the distance between the
spheres. For this system Bjerknes' results are reversed, the
law being now that of attraction in the case of unlike phases,
and of repulsion in the case of like phases : the intensity is as
before proportional to the inverse square of the distance. The same author afterwards discussed \ the oscillations which may be produced in an elastic medium by the
displacement, in the direction of the tangent to the crosssection, of the surfaces of tubes of small sectional area : the tubes either forming closed curves, or extending indefinitely in both directions. The direction and circumstances
of the motion are in general analogous to ordinary vortex- motions in an incompressible fluid ; and it was shown by Leahy
that, if the period of the oscillation be such that the waves
produced are long compared with ordinary finite distances, the
displacement due to the tangential disturbances is proportional
to the velocity due to vortex-rings of the same form as the
tubular surfaces. One of these " oscillatory twists," as the
tubular surfaces may be called, produces a displacement which
is analogous to the magnetic force due to a current flowing in a curve coincident with the tube ; the strength of the current
being proportional to b'w sin pt, where b denotes the radius of the twist, and t sin pt its angular displacement. If the field of vibration is explored by a rectilineal twist of the same
period as that of the vibration, the twist will experience a force
* A theory of gravitation has heen hased by Korn on the assumption that
gravitating particles resemhle slightly compressible spheres immersed in an incompressible perfect fluid : the spheres execute pulsations, whose intensity corresponds
to the mass of the gravitating particles, and thus forces of the Newtonian kind are produced between them. Cf. Korn, Eine Theorie der Gravitation und der elect. Etscheinungen, Berlin, 1898.

at right angles to the plane containing the twist andthedirection of the displacement which would exist if the twistwere removed ; if the displacement of the medium be repre-sented by F sin pt, and the angular displacement of the twistby w sin pt, the magnitude of the force is proportional to thevector-product of V (in the direction of the displacement)andw (in the direction of the axis of the twist).
A model of magnetic action may evidently be constructedon the basis of these results. A bar-magnet must be regardedas vibrating tangentially, the direction of vibration beingparallel to the axis of the body. A cylindrical body carryinga current will have its surface also vibrating tangentially ; butin this case the direction of vibration will be perpendiculartothe axis of the cylinder. A statically electrified body, ontheother hand, may, as follows from the same author's earlier work,be regarded as analogous to a body whose surface vibratesinthe normal direction. We have now discussed models in which the magnetic forceis represented as the velocity in a liquid, and others in whichit is represented as the displacement in an elastic solid. Someyears before the date of Leahy's memoir, George FrancisFitz Gerald (b. 1851, d. 1901)* had instituted a comparisonbetween magnetic force and the velocity in a quasi-elasticsolid of the type first devised by MacCullagh.f An analogyis at once evident when it is noticed that the electromagneticequation
4?rD = curl H
is satisfied identically by the values
4?rD = curl e, H = e, where e denotes any vector; and that, on substituting thesevalues in the other electromagnetic equation, - curl (4irc

we obtain the equation
ee + c
2 curl curl e = 0, which is no other than the equation of motion of MacCullagh's
aether,* the specific inductive capacity corresponding to the
reciprocal of MacCullagh's constant of elasticity. In the
analogy thus constituted, electric displacement corresponds to the twist of the elements of volume of the aether ; and electric charge must evidently be represented as an intrinsic rotational
strain. Mechanical models of the electromagnetic field, based on
FitzGerald's analogy, were afterwards studied byA. Sommerfeld,f
by K. Keiff,J and by Sir J. Larmor. The last-named authorll supposed the electric charge to exist in the form of discrete
electrons, for the creation of which he suggested the following
ideal processIF : A filament of aether, terminating at two
nuclei, is supposed to be removed, and circulatory motion is imparted to the walls of the channel so formed, at each point
of its length, so as to produce throughout the medium a
rotational strain. When this has been accomplished, the
channel is to be filled up again with aether, which is to be
made continuous with its walls. When the constraint is removed from the walls of the channel, the circulation imposed
on them proceeds to undo itself, until this tendency is balanced
by the elastic resistance of the aether with which the channel
has been filled up ; thus finally the system assumes a state of equilibrium in which the nuclei, which correspond to a positive
and a negative electron, are surrounded by intrinsic rotational
strain. Models in which magnetic force is represented by the
velocity of an aether are not, however, secure from objection.
It is necessary to suppose that the aether is capable of flowing
like a perfect fluid in irrotational motion (which would corre-

spond to a steady magnetic field), and that it is at the sametime endowed with the power (which is requisite for theexplanation of electric phenomena) of resisting the rotationofany element of volume.* But when the aether moves irrota-tionally in the fashion which corresponds to a steady magneticfield, each element of volume acquires after a finite timearotatory displacement from its original orientation, in con-sequence of the motion ; and it might therefore be expectedthatthe quasi-elastic power of resisting rotation would be calledinto play i.e., that a steady magnetic field would developelectric phenomena.f
A further objection to all models in which magnetic forcecorresponds to velocity is that a strong magnetic field, beinginsuch models represented by a steady drift of the aether, mightbe expected to influence the velocity of propagation of light.The existence of such an effect appears, however, to be disprovedby the experiments of Sir Oliver Lodge ; J at any rate, unlessitis assumed that the aether has an inertia at least of the sameorder of magnitude as that of ponderable matter, in whichcasethe motion might be too slow to be measurable.
Again, the evidence in favour of the rotatory as opposedtothe linear character of magnetic phenomena has perhaps, onthewhole, been strengthened since Thomson originally basedhisconclusion on the magnetic rotation of light. This bringsusto the consideration of an experimental discovery.
In 1879 E. H. Hall, at that time a student at Baltimore,* Larmor (loc. cit.) suggested the analogy of a liquid filled with magneticmolecules under the action of an external magnetic field. It has often heen objected to the mathematical conception of a perfect fluidthat it contains no safeguard against slipping between adjacent layers, so thatthere is no justification for the usual assumption that the motion of <i perfect fluidis continuous. Larmor remarked that a rotational elasticity, such as is attributedto the medium above considered, furnishes precisely such a safeguard ; and thatwithout some property of this kind a continuous frictionless fluid cannot be imagined.t Larmor proposed to avoid this by assuming that the rotation which is resistedby an element of volume of the aether is the vector sum of the series of differentialrotations which it has experienced.

repeating an experiment which had been previously suggested
by H. A. Kowland, obtained a new action of a magnetic field on electric currents. A strip of gold leaf mounted on glass,
forming part of an electric circuit through which a current was passing, was placed between the poles of an electro- magnet, the plane of the strip being perpendicular to the
lines of magnetic force. The two poles of a sensitive galvanometer were then placed in connexion with different parts of the
strip, until two points at the same potential were found. Whenthe magnetic field was created or destroyed, a deflection of the
galvanometer needle was observed, indicating a change in the
relative potential of the two poles. It was thus shown that
the magnetic field produces in the strip of gold leaf a newelectromotive force, at right angles to the primary electromotive
force and to the magnetic force, and proportional to the product
of these forces. From the physical point of view we may therefore regard
Hall's effect as an additional electromotive force generated by
the action of the magnetic field on the current ; or alternatively we may regard it as a modification of the ohmic resistance of the metal, such as would be produced if the molecules of the
metal assumed a helicoidal structure about the lines of magnetic
force. From the latter point of view, all that is needed is to modify Ohm's law
S = E
(where S denotes electric current, k specific conductivity, and Eelectric force) so that it takes the form
S = KE + h [E . H]
where H denotes the imposed magnetic force, and h denotes a
constant on which the magnitude of Hall's phenomenondepends. It is a curious circumstance that the occurrence, in the case of magnetized bodies, of an additional term in Ohm'slaw, formed from a vector-product of E, had been expressly
suggested in Maxwell's Treatise*: although Maxwell had not- indicated the possibility of realizing it by Hall's experiment.

An interesting application of Hall's discovery was madeinthe same year by Boltzmann,* who remarked that it offeredaprospect of determining the absolute velocity of the electriccharges which carry the current in the strip. For if itissupposed that only one kind (vitreous or resinous) of electricityis in motion, the force on one of the charges tending to driveitto one side of the strip will be proportional to the vector-product of its velocity and the magnetic intensity. Assumingthat Hall's phenomenon is a consequence of this tendencyofcharges to move to one side of the strip, it is evident thatthevelocity in question must be proportional to the magnitudeofthe Hall electromotive force due to a unit magnetic field. Onthe basis of this reasoning, A. von Ettingshausenf found forthecurrent sent by one or two Daniell's cells through a gold stripa velocity of the order of 0*1 cm. per second. It is clear, however,that, if the current consists of both vitreous and resinous chargesin motion in opposite directions, Boltzmann's argument fails;for the two kinds of electricity would give opposite directionsto the current in Hall's phenomenon.
In the year following his discovery, Hall} extendedhisresearches in another direction, by investigating whetheramagnetic field disturbs the distribution of equipotential linesina dielectric which is in an electric field ; but no effect couldbeobserved. Such an effect, indeed,|| was not to be expectedontheoretical grounds; for when, in a material system, all thevelocities are reversed, the motion is reversed, it beingunderstood that, in the application of this theorem to electricaltheory, an electrostatic state is to be regarded as one of rest, anda current as a phenomenon of motion ; and if such a reversalbe* Wien Anz., 1880, p. 12.

place.
We must now consider the bearing of Hall's effect on
the question as to whether magnetism is a rotatory or a
linear phenomenon.* If magnetism be linear, electric currents must be rotatory; and if Hall's phenomenon be supposed to take
place in a horizontal strip of metal, the magnetic force being
directed vertically upwards, and the primary current flowing
horizontally from north to south, the only geometrical entities involved are the vertical direction and a rotation in the east- and-west vertical plane ; and these are indifferent with respect
to a rotation in the north-and- south vertical plane, so that there
is nothing in the physical circumstances of the system to determine in which direction the secondary current shall flow. The hypothesis that magnetism is linear appears therefore
to be inconsistent with the existence of Hall's effect, f There
are, however, some considerations which may be urged on the
other side. Hall's effect, like the magnetic rotation of light,
takes place only in ponderable bodies, not in free aether ; and
its direction is sometimes in one sense, sometimes in the other,
according to the nature of the substance. It may therefore be
doubted whether these phenomena are not of a secondary
character, and the argument based on them invalid. Moreover,
as Fitz Gerald remarked,^ the magnetic lines of force associated
with a system of currents are circuital and have no open ends,
making it difficult to imagine how alteration of rotation inside them could be produced.
Of the various attempts to represent electric and magnetic
phenomena by the motions and strains of a continuous medium,
none of those hitherto considered has been found free from

objection.* Before proceeding to consider models which arenotconstituted by a continuous medium, mention must be madeofa suggestion offered by Biemann in his lecturesf of 1861. Riemann remarked that the scalar-potential and vector-potentiala, corresponding to his own law of force between electrons,satisfy the equation
+ div a = ; an equation which, as we have seen, is satisfied also bythepotentials of L. Lorenz.j This appeared to Riemann to indicatethat <j> might represent the density of an aether, of whicharepresents the velocity. It will be observed that on thishypothesis the electric and magnetic forces correspond to secondderivates of the displacement a circumstance which makesitsomewhat difficult to assimilate the energy possessed bytheelectromagnetic field to the energy of the model.
We must now proceed to consider those models in whichthe aether is represented as composed of more than one kindofconstituent : of these Maxwell's model of 1861-2, formedofvortices and rolling particles, may be taken as the type. Anotherdevice of the same class was described in 1885 by Fitz Gerald;this was constituted of a number of wheels, free to rotateonaxes fixed perpendicularly in a plane board ; the axes were fixedat the intersections of two systems of perpendicular lines ; andeach wheel was geared to each of its four neighbours byanindiarubber band. Thus all the wheels could rotate withoutany straining of the system, provided they all had the sameangular velocity; but if some of the wheels were revolvingfaster than others, the indiarubber bands would become strained.It is evident that the wheels in this model play the samepartas the vortices in Maxwell's model of 1861-2 : their rotationis* Cf.

^B Models of the Aether. 325the analogue of magnetic force ; and a region in which the masses
of the wheels are large corresponds to a region of high magnetic
permeability. The indiarubber bands of Fitz Gerald's modelcorrespond to the medium in which Maxwell's vortices wereembedded ; and a strain on the bands represents dielectric polarization, the line joining the tight and slack sides of any bandbeing the direction of displacement. A body whose specific
inductive capacity is large would be represented by a region
in which the elasticity of the bands is feeble. Lastly,
conduction may be represented by a slipping of the bandson the wheels.
Such a model is capable of transmitting vibrations analogous
to those of light. For if any group of wheels be suddenly set in rotation, those in the neighbourhood will be prevented bytheir inertia from immediately sharing in the motion; but
presently the rotation will be communicated to the adjacent
wheels, which will transmit it to their neighbours; and so a wave of motion will be propagated through the medium. Themotion constituting the wave is readily seen to be directed in the plane of the wave, i.e. the vibration is transverse. The axes
of rotation of the wheels are at right angles to the direction
of propagation of the wave, and the direction of polarization of the bands is at right angles to both these directions. The elastic bands may be replaced by lines of governor
balls :* if this be done, the energy of the system is entirely of the kinetic type.f
Models of types different from the foregoing have been
suggested by the researches of Helmholtz and W. Thomson on
vortex-motion. The earliest attempts in this direction, however, were intended to illustrate the properties of ponderable matter
rather than of the luminiferous medium. A vortex existing in a perfect fluid preserves its individuality throughout all changes,
* Fitz Gerald's Scient. Writings, p. 271. t It is of course possible to devise models of this class in which the rotation may
be interpreted as having the electric instead of the magnetic character. Such a model was proposed by Boltzinann, Vorlesungen iiber Maxwell's Theorie, ii.

and cannot be destroyed ; so that if, as Thomson* suggestedin1867, the atoms of matter are constituted of vortex-rings inaperfect fluid, the conservation of matter may be immediatelyexplained. The mutual interactions of atoms may be illustratedby the behaviour of smoke-rings, which after approachingeachother closely are observed to rebound : and the spectroscopicproperties of matter may be referred to the possessionbyvortex-rings of free periods of vibration.f
There are, however, objections to the hypothesis of vortex-atoms. It is not easy to understand how the large densityofponderable matter as compared with aether is to be explained;and further, the virtual inertia of a vortex-ring increases asitsenergy increases ; whereas the inertia of a ponderable bodyis,so far as is known, unaffected by changes of temperature.Itis, moreover, doubtful whether vortex-atoms would be stable." It now seems to me certain," wrote W. Thomson^ (Kelvin)in1905,
" that if any motion be given within a finite portionofan infinite incompressible liquid, originally at rest, its fateisnecessarily dissipation to infinite distances with infinitely smallvelocities everywhere; while the total kinetic energy remainsconstant. After many years of failure to prove that the motionin the ordinary Helmholtz circular ring is stable, I came totheconclusion that it is essentially unstable, and that its fate mustbe to become dissipated as now described." The vortex-atom hypothesis is not the only way in whichthe theory of vortex-motion has been applied to the construction of models of the aether. It was shown in 1880byW. Thomson that in certain circumstances a mass of fluid canexist in a state in which portions in rotational and irrotational* Phil. Mag. xxxiv(1867), p. 15; Proc. R.S. Edinb. vi, p. 94. t An attempt was made in 1883 by J. J. Thomson, Phil. Mag. xv (1883),p. 427, to explain the phenomena of the electric discharge through gases in termsof tho theory of vortex-atoms. The electric field was supposed to consist inadistribution of velocity in the medium whose vortex-motion constituted the atomsof the gas ; and Thomson considered the effect of this field on the dissociation andrecoupling of vortex-rings.

Models of the Aether. 327motion are finely mixed together, so that on a large scale the mass is homogeneous, having within any sensible volume an
equal amount of vortex-motion in all directions. To a fluid having such a type of motion he gave the name vortex-sponge.
TiveTyears later, Fitzgerald*" discussed the suitability of the
vortex-sponge as a model of the aether. Since vorticity in a
perfect fluid cannot be created or destroyed, the modification
of the system which is to be analogous to an electric field must
be a polarized state of the vortex motion, and light must be
represented by a communication of this polarized motion from
one part of the medium to another. Many distinct types of polarization may readily be imagined : for instance, if the
turbulent motion were constituted of vortex-rings, these might
be in motion parallel to definite lines or planes ; or if it were
constituted of long vortex filaments, the filaments might be
bent spirally about axes parallel to a given direction. The
energy of any polarized state of vortex-motion would be greater
than that of the unpolarized state; so that if the motion of matter had the effect of reducing the polarization, there would
be forces tending to produce that motion. Since the forces due
to a small vortex vary inversely as a high power of the distance
from it, it seems probable that in the case of two infinite planes, separated by a region of polarized vortex-motion, the
forces due to the polarization between the planes would depend on the polarization, but not on the mutual distance of the
planes a property which is characteristic of plane distributions whose elements attract according to the Newtonian law.
It is possible to conceive polarized forms of vortex- motion
which are steady so far as the interior of the medium is concerned, but which tend to yield up their energy in producing
motion of its boundary a property parallel to that of the
aether, which, though itself in equilibrium, tends to moveobjects immersed in it. In the same year Hicksf discussed the possibility of trans-

mitting waves through a medium consisting of an incompressiblefluid in which small vortex-rings are closely packed together.The wave-length of the disturbance was supposed large in comparison with the dimensions and mutual distances of the rings;and the translatory motion of the latter was supposed to besoslow that very many waves can pass over any one before it hasmuch changed its position. Such a medium would probablyact as a fluid for larger motions. The vibration in the wavefront might be either swinging oscillations of a ring aboutadiameter, or transverse vibrations of the ring, or aperturalvibrations ; vibrations normal to the plane of the ring appearto be impossible. Hicks determined in each case the velocityof translation, in terms of the radius of the rings, the distanceof their planes, and their cyclic constant. The greatest advance in the vortex-sponge theory of theaether was made in 1887, when W. Thomson* showed thattheequation of propagation of laminar disturbances in a vortex-sponge is the same as the equation of propagation of luminousvibrations in the aether. The demonstration, which in thecircumstances can scarcely be expected to be either very simpleor very rigorous, is as follows : Let (u, v, w) denote the components of velocity, and pthepressure, at the point (x, y, z) in an incompressible fluid. Letthe initial motion be supposed to consist of a laminar motion{/(?/), 0, Oj, superposed on a homogeneous, isotropic, andfine-grained distribution (u'0t v , w )
: so that at the origin of timethe velocity is {/ (y) + u' , v , wn \
: it is desired to findafunction / (y, t) such that at any time t the velocity shallbe \f(y, t) + u', v, w), where u', v, w, are quantities of whichevery average taken over a sufficiently large space is zero. Substituting these values of the components of velocityinthe equation of motion

Hence it appears that the quantity S, which is of the dimensions
of energy, must be proportional to the energy per unit-volume
of the medium a result which shows that there is a pronounced
similarity between the dynamics of a vortex-sponge and of Maxwell's elastic aether. A definite vortex-sponge model of the aether was described
by Hicks in his Presidential Address to the mathematical
section of the British Association in 1895.* In this the small
motions whose function is to confer the quasi-rigidity were not
completely chaotic, but were disposed systematically. The
medium was supposed to be constituted of cubical elements of
fluid, each containing a rotational circulation complete in itself : in any element, the motion close to the central vertical diameter
of the element is vertically upwards : the fluid which is thus
carried to the upper part of the element flows outwards over
the top, down the sides, and up the centre again. In each of the six adjoining elements the motion is similar to this, but in the reverse direction. The rotational motion in the elements
confers on them the power of resisting distortion, so that waves may be propagated through the medium as through an elastic solid ; but the rotations are without effect on irrotational motions of the fluid, provided the velocities in the irrotational motion are slow compared with the velocity of propagation of
distortional vibrations. A different model was described four years later by
Fitz Gerald,f Since the distribution of velocity of a fluid in the

neighbourhood of a vortex filament is the same as the distribu-tion of magnetic force around a wire of identical form carryingan electric current, it is evident that the fluid has more energywhen the filament has the form of a helix than whenitisstraight ; so if space were filled with vortices, whoseaxeswere all parallel to a given direction, there would beanincrease in the energy per unit volume when the vorticeswere bent into a spiral form ; and this could be measuredbythe square of a vector say, E which may be supposed parallelto this direction.
If now a single spiral vortex is surrounded by parallelstraight ones, the latter will not remain straight, but willbebent by the action of their spiral neighbour. The transferenceof spirality may be specified by a vector H, which will bedis-tributed in circles round the spiral vortex ; its magnitudewilldepend on the rate at which spirality is being lost bytheoriginal spiral, and can be taken such that its square is equalto the mean energy of this new motion. The vectors E andHwill then represent the electric and magnetic vectors;thevortex spirals representing tubes of electric force. Fitz Gerald's spirality is essentially similar to the laminarmotion investigated by Lord Kelvin, since it involves a flowinthe direction of the axis of the spiral, and such a flow cannottake place along the direction of a vortex filament withoutaspiral deformation of a filament. Other vortex analogues have been devised for electrostatical systems. One such, which was described in 1888byW. M. Hicks,* depends on the circumstance that if two bodiesin contact in an infinite fluid are separated from each other,andif there be a vortex filament which terminates on the bodies,there will be formed at the point where they separate a hollowvortex filamentf stretching from one to the other, with rotation* Brit. Assoc. Rep., 1888, p. 577.

equal and opposite to that of the original filament. As the
bodies are moved apart, the hollow vortex may, through failure
of stability, dissociate into a number of smaller ones ; and if the resulting number be very large, they will ultimately take
up a position of stable equilibrium. The two sets of filaments
the original filaments and their hollow companions will be
intermingled, and each will distribute itself according to the same law as the lines of force between the two bodies which are equally and oppositely electrified. Since the pressure inside a hollow vortex is zero, the portion
of the surface on which it abuts experiences a diminution of pressure ; the two bodies are therefore attracted. Moreover, as the two bodies separate further, the distribution of the filaments
being the same as that of lines of electric force, the diminution
of pressure for each line is the same at all distances, and therefore the force between the two bodies follows the same law as the force between two bodies equally and oppositely electrified. It may be shown that the effect of the original filaments is similar, the diminution of pressure being half as large again as
for the hollow vortices.
If another surface were brought into the presence of the
others, those of the filaments which encounter it would break
off and rearrange themselves so that each part of a broken
filament terminates on the new body. This analogy thus gives a complete account of electrostatic actions both quantitatively
and qualitatively : the electric charge on a body corresponds
to the number of ends of filaments abutting on it, the sign
being determined by the direction of rotation of the filament
as viewed from the body.
A magnetic field may be supposed to be produced by the
motion of the vortex filaments through the stationary aether,
the magnetic force being at right angles to the filament and to
its direction of motion. Electrostatic and magnetic fields thus
correspond to states of motion in the medium, in which, however, there is no bodily flow; for the two kinds of filament
produce circulation in opposite directions.
336 Models of the Aether.
It is possible that hollow vortices are better adapted thanordinary vortex-filaments for the construction of models oftheaether. Such, at any rate, was the opinion of Thomson (Kelvin)in his later years.* The analytical difficulties of the subjectareformidable, and progress is consequently slow ; but amongthemany mechanical schemes which have been devised to representelectrical and optical phenomena, none possesses greater interestthan that which pictures the aether as a vortex-sponge.

CHAPTEE X.
THE FOLLOWERS OF MAXWELL.
THE most notable imperfection in the electromagnetic theory
of light, as presented in Maxwell's original memoirs, was the
absence of any explanation of reflexion and refraction. Before
the publication of Maxwell's Treatise, however, a method of supplying the omission was indicated by Helmholtz.* The
principles on which the explanation depends are that the
normal component of the electric displacement D, the tangential
components of the electric force E, and the magnetic vector B
or H, are to be continuous across the interface at which the
reflexion takes place; the optical difference between the con- tiguous bodies being represented by a difference in their
dielectric constants, and the electric vector being assumed to be at right angles to the plane of polarization.-)- The analysis
required is a mere transcription of MacCullagh's theory of
reflexion,| if the derivate of MacCullagh's displacement e with
respect to the time be interpreted as the magnetic force,
fi curl e as the electric force, and curl e as the electric displacement. The mathematical details of the solution were not given
by Helmholtz himself, but were supplied a few years later in the inaugural dissertation of H. A. Lorentz. In the years immediately following the publication of Maxwell's Treatise, a certain amount of evidence in favour of
* Journal fur Math. Ixxii (1870), p. 68, note. t Helmholtz (loc. cit.) pointed out that if the optical difference between the media were assumed to be due to a difference in their magnetic permeabilities, it would be necessary to suppose the magnetic vector at right angles to the plane of
polarization in order to obtain Fresnel's sine and tangent formulae of reflexion. I Cf. pp. 148, 149, 154-156.

his theory was furnished by experiment. That an electric fieldis closely concerned with the propagation of light was demonstrated in 1875, when John Kerr* showed that dielectricssubjected to powerful electrostatic force acquire the propertyof double refraction, their optical behaviour being similartothat of uniaxal crystals whose axes are directed along the linesof force. Other researches undertaken at this time had a more directbearing on the questions at issue between the hypothesisofMaxwell and the older potential theories. In 1875-6 Helmholtzfand his pupil Schiller^ attempted to discriminate betweenthevarious doctrines and formulae relative to unclosed circuitsbyperforming a crucial experiment.
It was agreed in all theories that a ring-shaped magnet,which returns into itself so as to have no poles, can exertnoponderomotive force on other magnets or 011 closed electriccurrents. Helmholtz had, however, shown in 1873 that according to the potential-theories such a magnet would exertaponderomotive force on an unclosed current. The matterwastested by suspending a magnetized steel ring by a long fibrein a closed metallic case, near which was placed a terminalofa Holtz machine. No ponderomotive force could be observedwhen the machine was put in action so as to produce a brushdischarge from the terminal : from which it was inferredthatthe potential-theories do not correctly represent the phenomena,at least when displacement-currents and convection-currents(such as that of the electricity carried by the electrically repelledair from the terminal) are not taken into account. The researches of Helmholtz and Schiller broughtintoprominence the question as to the effects produced bythe* Phil. Mag.

translatory motion of electric charges. That the convection
of electricity is equivalent to a current had been suggested
long before by Faraday.* "If," he wrote in 1838, "a baU
be electrified positively in the middle of a room and be then
moved in any direction, effects will be produced as if a current
in the same direction had existed." To decide the matter
a new experiment inspired by Helmholtz was performed by
H. A. Kowlandf in 1876. The electrified body in Kowland's
disposition was a disk of ebonite, coated with gold leaf and
capable of turning rapidly round a vertical axis between two
fixed plates of glass, each gilt on one side. The gilt faces
of the plates could be earthed, while the ebonite disk received
electricity from a point placed near its edge ; each coating of the disk thus formed a condenser with the plate nearest to it. An astatic needle was placed above the upper condenser-plate,
nearly over the edge of the disk; and when the disk was rotated a magnetic field was found to be produced. This experiment,
which has since been repeated under improved conditions by
Kowland and Hutchinson,J H. Fender , and Eichenwald,|| shows
that the " convection-current " produced by the rotation of a charged disk, when the other ends of the lines of force are on an
earthed stationary plate parallel to it, produces the same magnetic field as an ordinary conduction-current flowing in a circuit which coincides with the path of the convection-current. Whentwo disks forming a condenser are rotated together, the
magnetic action is the sum of the magnetic actions of each of the disks separately. It appears, therefore, that electric charges
cling to the matter of a conductor and move with it, so far as Rowland's phenomenon is concerned.
The first examination of the matter from the point of view
of Maxwell's theory was undertaken by J. J. Thomson,1[ in 1881.
If an electrostatically charged body is in motion, the change in

the location of the charge must produce a continuous alterationof the electric field at any point in the surrounding medium; or,in the language of Maxwell's theory, there must be displacementcurrents in the medium. It was to these displacement-currentsthat Thomson, in his original investigation, attributedthemagnetic effects of moving charges. The particular systemwhich he considered was that formed by a charged sphericalconductor, moving uniformly in a straight line. It was assumedthat the distribution of electricity remains uniform overthesurface during the motion, and that the electric field in anyposition of the sphere is the same as if the sphere wereatrest ; these assumptions are true so long as quantities of order(V/c)
2 are neglected, where v denotes the velocity of the sphereand c the velocity of light.
Thomson's method was to determine the displacementcurrents in the space outside the sphere from the knownvalues of the electric field, and then to calculate the vector-potential due to these displacement-currents by means of theformula
where S' denotes the displacement-current at (x'y'z
f). Themagnetic field was then determined by the equation
H = curl A. A defect in this investigation was pointed out by Fitz Gerald,who, in a short but most valuable note,* published a few monthsafterwards, observed that the displacement-currents of Thomsondo not satisfy the circuital condition. This is most simplyseenby considering the case in which the system consists of twoparallel plates forming a condenser; if one of the platesisfixed, and the other plate is moved towards it, the electric fieldis annihilated in the space over which the moving plate travels:this destruction of electric displacement constitutes a displacement-current, which, considered alone, is evidently not a closed* Proc. Roy. Dublin Soc., November, 1881 ; Fitz Gerald's Scientific Writings,p. 102.
The Followers #/ Maxwell. 341
current. The defect, as Fitz Gerald showed, may be immediately
removed by assuming that a moving charge itself is to be counted
as a current-element : the total current, thus composed of the
displacement- currents and the convection-current, is circuital. Making this correction, Fitz Gerald found that the magnetic
force due to a sphere of charge e moving with velocity v along
the axis of z is curl (0, 0, ev/r) a formula which shows that the
displacement-currents have no resultant magnetic effect, since the term ev/r would be obtained from the convection-current
alone.The expressions obtained by Thomson and Fitz Gerald were
correct only to the first order of the small quantity v/c. The
effect of including terms of higher order was considered in 1889
by Oliver Heaviside,* whose solution may be derived in the
following manner : Suppose that a charged system is in motion with uniform
velocity v parallel to the axis of z ; the total current consists of the displacement-current E/4?rc
2 where E denotes the electric
force, and the convection-current pv where p denotes the
volume-density of electricity. So the equation which connects magnetic force with electric current may be written
E/c
2 = curl H -
4:irpv. Eliminating E between this and the equation
curl E = -
H,
and remembering that H is here circuital, we have
H/c
2 - V
2H = 4?r curl pv.
If, therefore, a vector-potential a be defined by the equation
a/c
3 - V
2 a =
4?rpv,
the magnetic force will be the curl of a ; and from the equation
for a it is evident that the components ax and ay are zero, and
that az is to be determined from the equation
az/c~ - V"az =
4npv.

a perfectly conducting sphere whose centre is at the point, the
only chaftge being that E and H would now vanish inside the
sphere. This inference was subsequently found* to be incorrect : a distribution of electric charge on a moving sphere could in
fact not be in equilibrium if the electric force were radial, since there would then be nothing to balance the mechanical force exerted on the moving charge (which is equivalent to a current)
by the magnetic field. The moving system which gives rise to the same field as a moving point-charge is not a sphere, but an
oblate spheroid whose polar axis (which is in the direction of motion) bears to its equatorial axis the ratio (1 -
tf/c*)^ : !.) The energy of the field surrounding a charged sphere is greater when the sphere is in motion than when it is at rest. To determine the additional energy quantitatively (retaining
only the lowest significant powers of v/c), we have only to
integrate, throughout the space outside the sphere, the expression
H2/87r, which represents the electrokinetic energy per unit
volume : the result is e
zv~/3a, where e denotes the charge, v the
velocity, and a the radius of the sphere.
It is evident from this result that the work required to be
done in order to communicate a given velocity to the sphere
is greater when the sphere is charged than when it is uncharged ; that is to say, the virtual mass of the sphere is increased by an amount 2e2/3a, owing to the presence of the charge. This maybe regarded as arising from the self-induction of the convection- current which is formed when the charge is set in motion. It was suggested by J. LarmorJ and by W. Wien that the inertia
of ordinary ponderable matter may ultimately prove to be of
this nature, the atoms being constituted of systems of electrons. || By G. F. C. Searle. t Cf. Searle, Phil. Trans, clxxxvii (1896), p. 675, and Phil. Ma? . xliv (1897),

It may, however, be remarked that this view of th>riginofmass is not altogether consistent with the principle^thattheelectron is an indivisible entity. For the so-called self-inductionof the spherical electron is really the mutual induction of theconvection-currents produced by the elements of electric chargewhich are distributed over its surface ; and the calculationofthis quantity presupposes the divisibility of the total chargeintoelements capable of acting severally in all respects as ordinaryelectric charges ; a property which appears scarcely consistentwith the supposed fundamental nature of the electron. After the first attempt of J. J. Thomson to determinethefield produced by a moving electrified sphere, the mathematicaldevelopment of Maxwell's theory proceeded rapidly. Theproblems which admit of solution in terms of known functionsare naturally those in which the conducting surfaces involvedhave simple geometrical forms planes, spheres, and cylinders.*A result which was obtained by Horace Lamb,f wheninvestigating electrical motions in a spherical conductor,ledto interesting consequences. Lamb found that if a sphericalconductor is placed in a rapidly alternating field, the inducedcurrents are almost entirely confined to a superficial layer ; andhis result was shortly afterwards generalized by Oliver Heaviside,| who showed that whatever be the form of a conductorrapidly alternating currents do not penetrate far into its substance.

rapid, the. conductor has not time (so to speak) to display
the impSfection of its conductivity, and the magnetic field
is therefore unable to extend far below the surface. The same conclusion may be reached by different reasoning.*
When the alternations of the current are very rapid, the ohmic
resistance ceases to play a dominant part, and the ordinary
equations connecting electromotive force, induction, and current
are equivalent to the conditions that the currents shall be so distributed as to make the electrokinetic or magnetic energy a minimum. Consider now the case of a single straight wire of circular cross-section. The magnetic energy in the space outside
the wire is the same whatever be the distribution of current in the cross-section (so long as it is symmetrical about the centre),
since it is the same as if the current were flowing along the
central axis ; so the condition is that the magnetic energy in the wire shall be a minimum ; and this is obviously satisfied when the current is concentrated in the superficial layer, since then the magnetic force is zero in the substance of the wire. In spite of the advances which were effected by Maxwell
and his earliest followers in the theory of electric oscillations,
the gulf between the classical electrodynamics and the theory
of light was not yet completely bridged. For in all the cases considered in the former science, energy is merely exchanged
between one body and another, remaining within the limits of a given system ; while in optics the energy travels freely through
space, unattached to any material body. The first discovery of a more complete connexion between the two theories was made
by Fitz Gerald, who argued that if the unification which had
been indicated by Maxwell is valid, it ought to be possible to generate radiant energy by purely electrical means; and in 1883f he described methods by which this could be done.
Fitz Gerald's system is what has since become known as the magnetic oscillator : it consists of a small circuit, in which

the strength of the current is varied according to the simpleperiodic law. The circuit will be supposed to be ft circleofsmall area S, whose centre is the origin and whose plane is theplane of xy ; and the surrounding medium will be supposedto be free aether. The current may be taken to be of strengthA cos (2ni?/jF), so that the moment of the equivalent magnetis SA cos (2irt/T). Now in the older electrodynamics,thevector-potential due to a magnetic molecule of (vector) momentM at the origin is (l/47r) curl (M/r), where r denotes distancefrom the origin. The vector-potential due to Fitz Gerald'smagnetic oscillator would therefore be (l/47r) curl K, whereKdenotes a vector parallel to the axis of z, and of magnitude(1/r) SA cos (2-n-t/ T). The change which is involved in replacingthe assumptions of the older electrodynamics by thoseofMaxwell's theory is in the present case equivalent* to retardingthe potential ; so that the vector-potential a due to the oscillatoris (l/47r) curl K where K is still directed parallel to the axisofz, and is of magnitude

radiant energy of magnetic type ma}' be calculated in a similar
way, and is found to have the same value ; so the total radiant

and therefore the energy radiated in unit time is 16ir4t A'iS
2/3c
s T*. This is small, unless the frequency is very high ; so that
ordinary alternating currents would give no appreciable radiation. Fitz Gerald, however, in the same year* indicated a method by which the difficulty of obtaining currents of
sufficiently high frequency might be overcome: this was, to employ the alternating currents which are produced whena condenser is discharged.
The Fitz Gerald radiator constructed on this principle is closely akin to the radiator afterwards developed with such
success by Hertz : the only difference is that in Fitz Gerald's
arrangement the condenser is used merely as the store of energy (its plates being so close together that the electrostatic
field due to the charges is practically confined to the space
between them), and the actual source of radiation is the
alternating magnetic field due to the circular loop of wire:
while in Hertz's arrangement the loop of wire is abolished,
the condenser plates are at some distance apart, and the source
of radiation is the alternating electrostatic field due to their charges.
In the study of electrical radiation, valuable help is afforded by a general theorem on the transfer of energy in the electro- magnetic field, which was discovered in 1884 by John HenryPoynting.-)- We have seen that the older writers on electric currents recognized that an electric current is associated with
the transport of energy from one place (e.g. the voltaic cell which maintains the current) to another (e.g. an electromotor
which is worked by the current) ; but they supposed the energy
to be conveyed by the current itself within the wire, in much*

the same way as dynamical energy is carried by water flowingin a pipe; whereas in Maxwell's theory, the storehouseandvehicle of energy is the dielectric medium surrounding the wire.What Poynting achieved was to show that the flux of energyatany place might be expressed by a simple formula in termsofthe electric and magnetic forces at the place.
Denoting as usual by E the electric force, by D the electricdisplacement, by H the magnetic force, and by B the magneticinduction, the energy stored in unit volume of the mediumis*l ED + (1/8*) BH ; so the increase of this in unit time is (since in isotropic mediaD is proportional to E, and B is proportional to H)

Now (E . i) is the amount of electric energy transformedintoheat per unit volume per second; and therefore the quantity-

In the special case of the field which surrounds a straight
wire carrying a continuous current, the lines of magnetic force are circles round the axis of the wire, while the lines of electric force are directed along the wire ; hence energy must be flowing
in the medium in a direction at right angles to the axis of the
wire. A current in any conductor may therefore be regarded
as consisting essentially of a convergence of electric and magnetic
energy from the medium upon the conductor, and its trans- formation there into other forms. This association of a current with motions at right angles to the wire in which it flows doubtless suggested to Poynting the
conceptions of a memoir which he published* in the following
year. When an electric current flowing in a straight wire is gradually increased in strength from zero, the surrounding space
becomes filled with lines of magnetic force, which have the form
of circles round the axis of the wire. Poynting, adopting
Faraday's idea of the physical reality of lines of force, assumed
that these lines of force arrive at their places by moving out- wards from the wire ; so that the magnetic field grows by a continual emission from the wire of lines of force, which enlarge
and spread out like the circular ripples from the place where a. stone is dropped into a pond. The electromotive force which is- associated with a changing magnetic field was now attributed
directly to the motion of the lines of force, so that wherever
electromotive force is produced by change in the magnetic field,, or by motion of matter through the field, the electric intensity
is equal to the number of tubes of magnetic force intersected
by unit length in unit time. A similar conception was introduced in regard to lines of
electric force. It was assumed that any change in the total

electric induction through a curve is caused by the passageoftubes of force in or out across the boundary ; so that whenevermagnetomotive force is produced by change in the electric field,or by motion of matter through the field, the magnetomotiveforce is proportional to the number of tubes of electric forceintersected by unit length in unit time. Poynting, moreover, assumed that when a steady currentCflows in a straight wire, C tubes of electric force close in uponthe wire in unit time, and are there dissolved, their energyappearing as heat. If E denote the magnitude of the electricforce, the energy of each tube per unit length is \E,sothe amount of energy brought to the wire is \CE perunitlength per unit time. This is, however, only half the energyactually transformed into heat in the wire : so Poynting furtherassumed that E tubes of magnetic force also move in perunitlength per unit time, and finally disappear by contractiontoinfinitely small rings. This motion accounts for the existenceof- the electric field ; and since each tube (which is a closed ring)contains energy of amount J(7, the disappearance of the tubesaccounts for the remaining \GE units of energy dissipatedinthe wire. The theory of moving tubes of force has been extensivelydeveloped by Sir Joseph Thomson.* Of the two kinds of tubesmagnetic and electric which had been introduced by Faradayand used by Poynting, Thomson resolved to discard the formerand employ only the latter. This was a distinct departurefrom Faraday's conceptions, in which, as we have seen, greatsignificance was attached to the physical reality of the magneticlines ; but Thomson justified his choice by inferences drawnfrom the phenomena of electric conduction in liquids and gases.As will appear subsequently, these phenomena indicate thatmolecular structure is closely connected with tubes of electrostatic force perhaps much more closely than with tubesofmagnetic force ; and Thomson therefore decided to regard* Phil. Mag. xxxi (1891), p. 149; Thomson's Recent Researches in Elect,andMag. (1893), chapter i.
The Followers of Maxwell. 351
magnetism as the secondary effect, and to ascribe magnetic
fields, not to the presence of magnetic tubes, but to the motion
of electric tubes. In order to account for the fact that magnetic
fields may occur without any manifestation of electric force, he
assumed that tubes exist in great numbers everywhere in space, either in the form of closed circuits or else terminating on atoms,
and that electric force is only perceived when the tubes have a
greater tendency to lie in one direction than in another. In a
steady magnetic field the positive and negative tubes might be
conceived to be moving in opposite directions with equal
velocities. A beam of light might, from this point of view, be regarded
simply as a group of tubes of force which are moving with the
velocity of light at right angles to their own length. Such a
conception almost amounts to a return to the corpuscular
theory ; but since the tubes have definite directions per- pendicular to the direction of propagation, there would nowbe no difficulty in explaining polarization.
The energy accompanying all electric and magnetic pheno- mena was supposed by Thomson to be ultimately kinetic energy
of the aether ; the electric part of it being represented by rota- tion of the aether inside and about the tubes, and the magnetic
part being the energy of the additional disturbance set up in the aether by the movement of the tubes. The inertia of this latter motion he regarded as the cause of induced electromotive
force.There was, however, one phenomenon of the electromagnetic
field as yet unexplained in terms of these conceptions namely,
the ponderomotive force which is exerted by the field on a conductor carrying an electric current. Now any ponderomotive force consists in a transfer of mechanical momentumfrom the agent which exerts the force to the body which
experiences it ; and it occurred to Thomson that the ponderomotive forces of the electromagnetic field might be explained if the moving tubes of force, which enter a conductor carrying a
current and are there dissolved, were supposed to possess

mechanical momentum, which could be yielded up to theconductor. It is readily seen that such momentum mustbedirected at right angles to the tube and to the magneticinduction a result which suggests that the momentumstoredin unit volume of the aether may be proportional to the vector-product of the electric and magnetic vectors. For this conjecture reasons of a more definite kind maybegiven.* We have already seenf that the ponderomotive forceson material bodies in the electromagnetic field may be accountedfor by Maxwell's supposition that across any plane in the aetherwhose unit normal is N, there is a stress represented by
PN
=
(D . N) E -
J (D .E)N + (l/47r) (B . H)H -
(I/Sir) (B. H)N.So long as the field is steady (i.e. electrostatic or magnetostatic)the resultant of the stresses acting on any element of volumeofthe aether is zero, so that the element is in equilibrium. Butwhen the field is variable, this is no longer the case. Theresultant stress on the aether contained within a surface SisJJ PN . dS
integrated over the surface : transforming this into a volumeintegral, the term (D . N) E gives a term div D . E + (D . V)E,where V denotes the vector operator (9/9a?, d/dy, d/dz) ; andthefirst of these terms vanishes, since D is a circuital vector;the term -
J (D . E) N gives in the volume-integral a termJ grad (D . E) ; and the magnetic terms give similar results.So the resultant force on unit-volume of the aether is (D . V) E + J grad (D . E) + (l/4ir) (B . V) E + (I /Sir) grad (B . H),which may be written
[curl E . D] + (l/47r) [curl H . B] ; * The hypothesis that the aether is a storehouse of mechanical momentum,which was first advanced by ,T. J. Thomson (Recent Researches in Elect, and Mag.(1893), p. 13), was afterwards developed by H. Poincare, Archives Neerl. (2)v(1900), p. 252, and by M. Abraham, Gott, Nach., 1902, p. 20. tCf. p. 302.

or, by virtue of the fundamental equations for dielectrics,
[- B . D] + [D . B] , or (a/ft) [D . B].
This result compels us to adopt one of three alternatives:
either to modify the theory so as to reduce to zero the resultant
force on an element of free aether ; this expedient has not met
with general favour ;* or to assume that the force in question
sets the aether in motion: this alternative was chosen by
Helmholtz,f but is inconsistent with the theory of the aether
which was generally received in the closing years of the century;
or lastly, with Thomson^ to accept the principle that the aether
is itself the vehicle of mechanical momentum, of amount [D . B]
per unit volume.
Maxwell's theory was now being developed in ways which
could scarcely have been anticipated by its author. But although
every year added something to the superstructure, the foundations remained much as Maxwell had laid them ; the doubtful
argument by which he had sought to justify the introduction
of displacement- currents was still all that was offered in their defence. In 1884, however, the theory was established on a
different basis by a pupil of Helmholtz', Heinrich Hertz
(b. 1857, d. 1894).
The train of Hertz' ideas resembles that by which Ampere,
on hearing of Oersted's discovery of the magnetic field produced
by electric currents, inferred that electric currents should exert ponderomotive forces on each other. Ampere argued that a
current, being competent to originate a magnetic field, must be
equivalent to a magnet in other respects ; and therefore that
currents, like magnets, should exhibit forces of mutual attraction
and repulsion.
* It was, however, adopted by G. T. "Walker, Aberration and the Electromagnetic
Field, Camb., 1900. t Berlin Sitzungsberichte, 1893, p. 649; Ann. d. Phys. liii (1894), p. 135. Helmholtz supposed the aether to behave as a frictionless incompressible fluid. + Loc. cit. Ann. d.

Ampere's reasoning rests on the assumption that the magnetic field produced by a current is in all respects of the samenature as that produced by a magnet ; in other words, thatonlyone land of magnetic force exists. This principle of the " unityof magnetic force" Hertz now proposed to supplement by assert-ing that the electric force generated by a changing magneticfield is identical in nature with the electric force due to electrostatic charges; this second principle he called the "unityofelectric force." Suppose, then, that a system of electric currentsi exists in otherwise empty space. According to the oldertheory, these currents give rise to a vector-potential a, , equalto Pot i ;* and the magnetic force Ht is the curl of a t
: whilethe electric force E! at any point in the field, produced bythevariation of the currents, is ai. It is now assumed that the electric force so producedisindistinguishable from the electric force which would besetup by electrostatic charges, and therefore that the systemofvarying currents exerts ponderomobive forces on electrostaticcharges ; the principle of action and reaction then requiresthatelectrostatic charges should exert ponderomotive forces onasystem of varying currents, and consequently (again appealingto the principle of the unity of electric force) that two systemsof varying currents should exert on each other ponderomotiveforces due to the variations. But just as Helmholtz,f by aid of the principle of conser-vation of energy, deduced the existence of an electromotiveforce of induction from the existence of the ponderomotiveforces between electric currents (Le. variable electric systems),so from the existence of ponderomotive forces between variablesystems of currents (i.e. variable magnetic systems) wemayinfer that variations in the rate of change of a variable magneticsystem give rise to induced magnetic forces in the surroundingspace. The analytical formulae which determine these forces* a = Pot /3 is used to denote the solution of the equation V'a + 47r =0.fCf. p. 243.
The Followers of Maxwell. 355will be of the same kind as in the electric case ; so that the
induced magnetic force H' is given by an equation of the form
where c denotes some constant, and bi, which is analogous to the vector-potential in the electric case, is a circuital vector whose curl is the electric force E! of the variable magnetic
system. The value of bi is therefore (l/47r) curl Pot Et

These are, however, the fundamental equations of Maxwell'stheory in the form given in his memoir of 1868,*
That Hertz's deduction is ingenious and interesting willreadily be admitted. That it is conclusive may scarcelybeclaimed : for the argument of Helmholtz regarding the induction of currents is not altogether satisfactory; and Hertz,infollowing his master, is on no surer ground.
In the course of a discussion^ on the validity of Hertz'sassumptions, which followed the publication of his paper,E. AulingerJ brought to light a contradiction betweentheprinciples of the unity of electric and of magnetic force andthe electrodynamics of Weber. Consider an electrostaticallycharged hollow sphere, in the interior of which is a wirecarrying a variable current. According to Weber's theory,the sphere would exert a turning couple on the wire;butaccording to Hertz's principles, no action would be exerted,since charging the sphere makes no difference to either theelectric or the magnetic force in its interior. The experimentthus suggested would be a crucial test of the correctnessofWeber's theory ; it has the advantage of requiring nothingbut closed currents and electrostatic charges at rest ; butthe quantities to be observed would be on the limitsofobservational accuracy.

After his attempt to justify the Maxwellian equations on
theoretical grounds, Hertz turned his attention to the possibility
of verifying them by direct experiment. His interest in the
matter had first been aroused some years previously, when the
Berlin Academy proposed as a prize subject
" To establish experimentally a relation between electromagnetic actions and
the polarization of dielectrics." Helmholtz suggested to Hertz
that he should attempt the solution ; but at the time he saw
no way of bringing phenomena of this kind within the limits of observation. From this time forward, however, the idea of electric oscillations was continually present to his mind ; and in the
spring of 1886 he noticed an effect* which formed the startingpoint of his later researches. When an open circuit was formed
of a piece of copper wire, bent into the form of a rectangle, so that the ends of the wire were separated only by a short air- gap, and when this open circuit was connected by a wire with
any point of a circuit through which the spark-discharge of an
induction-coil was taking place, it was found that a spark
passed in the air-gap of the open circuit. This was explained
by supposing that the change of potential, which is propagated
along the connecting wire from the induction-coil, reaches one end of the open circuit before it reaches the other, so that a spark passes between them; and the phenomenon therefore was regarded as indicating a finite velocity of propagation of
electric potential along wires.!
* Ann. d. Phys. xxxi (1887), p. 421. Hertz's Electric Waves, translated by
D. E. Jones, p. 29. t Unknown to Hertz, the transmission of electric waves along wires had been
observed in 1870 by Wilhelm von Bezold, Miinchen Sitzungsbericlite, i (1870),
p. 113 ; Phil. Mag. xl (1870), p. 42. * If," he wrote at the conclusion of a series of experiments, "electrical waves be sent into a wire insulated at the end, they
will be reflected at that end. The phenomena which accompany this process in alternating discharges appear to owe their origin to the interference of the advancing and reflected waves," and, "an electric discharge travels with the
atne rapidity in wires of equal length, without reference to the materials of which these wires are made." The subject was investigated by 0. J. Lodge and A. P. Chattock at almost the same time as Hertz's experiments were being carried out: mention was made of
their researches at the meeting of the British Association in 1888.
358 The Followers of Maxwell.
Continuing his experiments, Hertz* found that a sparkcould be induced in the open or secondary circuit even whenitwas not in metallic connexion with the primary circuit in whichthe electric oscillations were generated; and he rightly inter-preted the phenomenon by showing that the secondary circuitwas of such dimensions as to make the free period of electricoscillations in it nearly equal to the period of the oscillationsin the primary circuit ; the disturbance which passed fromonecircuit to the other by induction would consequently be greatlyintensified in the secondary circuit by resonance. The discovery that sparks may be produced in the air-gapof a secondary circuit, provided it has the dimensions properfor resonance, was of great importance : for it supplied a methodof detecting electrical effects in air at a distance from the primarydisturbance ; a suitable detector was in fact all that was neededin order to observe the propagation of electric waves in freespace, and thereby decisively test the Maxwellian theory. Tothis work Hertz now addressed himself.f
The radiator or primary source of the disturbances studiedby Hertz may be constructed of two sheets of metal in thesame plane, each sheet carrying a stiff wire which projectstowards the other sheet and terminates in a knob ; the sheetsare to be excited by connecting them to the terminals ofaninduction coil. The sheets may be regarded as the two coatingsof a modified Leyden jar, with air as the dielectric betweenthem ; the electric field is extended throughout the air, insteadof being confined to the narrow space between the coatings,asin the ordinary Leyden jar. Such a disposition ensures thatthe system shall lose a large part of its energy by radiationat each oscillation.
* Loc. cit. t Sir Oliver Lodge was about this time independently studying electric oscilla-tions in air in connexion with the theory of lightning-conductors : cf. Lodge,Phil. Mag. xxvi (1888), p. 217. So long before as 1842, Joseph Henry,ofWashington, had noticed that the inductive effects of the Leyden jar dischargecould be observed at considerable distances, and had even suggested a comparisonwith " a spark from flint and steel in the case of light."
The Followers of Maxwell. 359As in the jar discharge,* the electricity surges from one
sheet to the other, with a period proportional to (CL)l, wheredenotes the electrostatic capacity of the system formed bythe two sheets, and L denotes the self-induction of the
connexion. The capacity and induction should be made as small as possible in order to make the period small. Thedetector used by Hertz was that already described, namely,
a wire bent into an incompletely closed curve, and of such
dimensions that its free period of oscillation was the sameas that of the primary oscillation, so that resonance might take
place.
Towards the end of the year 1887, when studying the sparks
induced in the resonating circuit by the primary disturbance,
Hertz noticedf that the phenomena were distinctly modified
when a large mass of an insulating substance was brought
into the neighbourhood of the apparatus ; thus confirming the
principle that the changing electric polarization which is produced when an alternating electric force acts on a dielectric
is capable of displaying electromagnetic effects. Early in the following year (1888) Hertz determined to verify Maxwell's theory directly by showing that electro- magnetic actions are propagated in air with a finite velocity.{ For this purpose he transmitted the disturbance from the
primary oscillator by two different paths, viz., through the air and along a wire ; and having exposed the detector to the joint
influence of the two partial disturbances, he observed inter- ference between them. In this way he found the ratio of the
velocity of electric waves in air to their velocity when conducted
by wires ; and the latter velocity he determined by observing
the distance between the nodes of stationary waves in the wire,
and calculating the period of the primary oscillation. Thevelocity of propagation of electric disturbances in air was in

this way shown to be finite and of the same order as thevelocity of light.*
Later in 1888 Hertzf showed that electric waves in air arereflected at the surface of a wall ; stationary waves maythusbe produced, and interference may be obtained between directand reflected beams travelling in the same direction. The theoretical analysis of the disturbance emitted byaHertzian radiator according to Maxwell's theory was givenbyHertz in the following year.J
The effects of the radiator are chiefly determined bythefree electric charges which, alternately appearing at the twosides, generate an electric field by their presence and a magneticfield by their motion. In each oscillation, as the chargesonthe poles of the radiator increase from zero, lines of electricforce, having their ends on these poles, move outwards intothe surrounding space. When the charges on the poles attaintheir greatest values, the lines cease to issue outwards, andtheexisting lines begin to retreat inwards towards the poles; butthe outer lines of force contract in such a way that their upperand lower parts touch each other at some distance fromtheradiator, and the remoter portion of each of these lines thustakes the form of a loop ; and when the rest of the lineofforce retreats inwards towards the radiator, this loop becomesdetached and is propagated outwards as radiation. In thisway the radiator emits a series of whirl-rings, which as theymove grow thinner and wider; at a distance, the disturbance* Hertz's experiments gave the value 45/28 for the ratio of the velocityofelectric waves in air to the velocity of electric waves conducted by the wires, and2 x 10 10 cms. per sec. for the latter velocity. These numbers were afterwardsfound to be open to objection: Poincare (Comptes Rendus, cxi (1890), p. 322)showed that the period calculated by Hertz was V2 x the true period, which wouldmake the velocity of propagation in air equal to that of light x v'2. Ernst Lecher(Wiener Berichte, May 8, 1890; Phil. Mag. xxx (1890), p. 128), experimentingon the velocity of propagation of electric vibrations in wires, found insteadofHertz's 2 x 10 10 cms. per sec., a value within two per cent, of the velocityoflight. E. Sarasin and L. De La Rive at Geneva (Archives des Sc. Phys. xxix (1893))finally proved that the velocities of propagation in air and along wires are equal.t Ann. d. Phys. xxxiv (1888), p. 610.

is approximately a plane wave, the opposite sides of the ring
representing the two phases of the wave. When one of these
rings has become detached from the radiator, the energy contained may subsequently be regarded as travelling outwards
with it. To discuss the problem analytically* we take the axis of the radiator as axis of z, and the centre of the spark-gap as
origin. The field may be regarded as due to an electric doublet
formed of a positive and an equal negative charge, displaced
from each other along the axis of the vibrator, and of moment

perpendicular to the radius from the centre, where $1 dependsatany instant only on the distance from the vibrator, anddenotes the angle which the radius makes with the axis oftheoscillator. At points on the axis, and in the equatorial plane,the electric force is parallel to the axis. At a great distancefrom the oscillator, 2 is small compared with 0,, so the waveispurely transverse. The magnetic force is directed along circleswhose centres are on the axis of the radiator ; and its magnitudemay be represented in the form 3 sin 9, where 3 dependsonly on r and t ; at great distances from the radiator, c< 3 isapproximately equal to 0,. If the activity of the oscillator be supposed to be continuallymaintained, so that there is no damping, we may replace p{ byzero, and may proceed as in the case of the magnetic oscillator*to determine the amount of energy radiated. The meanout-ward flow of energy per unit time is found to be Jc
3^2 (27T/X)4;from which it is seen that the rate of loss of energy by radiationincreases greatly as the wave-length decreases. The action of an electrical vibrator may be studied bytheaid of mechanical models. In one of these, devised by Larmor,fthe aether is represented by an incompressible elastic solid,inwhich are two cavities, corresponding to the conductors of thevibrator, filled with incompressible fluid of negligible inertia.The electric force is represented by the displacement of thesolid. For such rapid alternations as are here considered,the metallic poles behave as perfect conductors; andthetangential components of electric force at their surfaces'arezero. This condition may be satisfied in the model by supposing the lining of each cavity to be of flexible sheet-metal, soasto be incapable of tangential displacement ; the normal displacement of the lining then corresponds to the surface-densityofelectric charge on the conductor.
In order to obtain oscillations in the solid resembling thoseof an electric vibrator, we may suppose that the two cavities* Cf. p. 346.

have the form of semicircular tubes forming the two halves
of a complete circle. Each tube is enlarged at each of
its ends, so as to present a front of considerable area to the
corresponding front at the end of the other tube. Thus at each
end of one diameter of the circle there is a pair of opposing
fronts, which are separated from each other by a thin sheet
of the elastic solid. The disturbance may be originated by forcing an excess of liquid into one of the enlarged ends of one of the cavities. This
involves displacing the thin sheet of elastic solid, which
separates it from the opposing front of the other cavity, and
thus causing a corresponding deficiency of liquid in the enlarged
end behind this front. The liquid will then surge backwards
and forwards in each cavity between its enlarged ends ; and,
the motion being communicated to the elastic solid, vibrations
will be generated resembling those which are produced in the
aether by a Hertzian oscillator. In the latter part of the year 1888 the researches of Hertz*
yielded more complete evidence of the similarity of electric waves to light. It was shown that the part of the radiation
from an oscillator which was transmitted through an opening in a screen was propagated in a straight line, with diffraction effects. Of the other properties of light, polarization existed in the
original radiation, as was evident from the manner in which it was produced ; and polarization in other directions was obtained
by passing the waves through a grating of parallel metallic wires ; the component of the electric force parallel to the wires was
absorbed, so that in the transmitted beam the electric vibration was at right angles to the wires. This effect obviously resembled
the polarization of ordinary light by a plate of tourmaline.

The old question as to whether the light-vector is in, oratright angles to, the plane of polarization* now presented itselfin a new aspect. The wave-front of an electric wave containstwo vectors, the electric and magnetic, which are at right anglesto each other. Which of these is in the plane of polarization?The answer was furnished by Fitz Gerald and Trouton,f whofound on reflecting Hertzian waves from a wall of masonrythatno reflexion was obtained at the polarizing angle whenthevibrator was in the plane of reflexion. The inference fromthisis that the magnetic vector is in the plane of polarization of theelectric wave, and the electric vector is at right angles to theplane of polarization. An interesting development followedin1890, when 0. Wiener^ succeeded in photographing stationarywaves of light. The stationary waves were obtained bythecomposition of a beam incident on a mirror with the reflectedbeam, and were photographed on a thin film of transparentcollodion, placed close to the mirror and slightly inclined toit.If the beam used in such an experiment is plane-polarized,andis incident at an angle of 45, the stationary vector is evidentlythat perpendicular to the plane of incidence; but Wienerfound that under these conditions the effect was obtained onlywhen the light was polarized in the plane of incidence; sothat the chemical activity must be associated with the vectorperpendicular to the plane of polarization i.e., the electricvector. In 1890 and the years immediately following appearedseveral memoirs relating to the fundamental equationsofelectro-magnetic theory.

content of Maxwell's theory for bodies at rest, proceeded* to extend the equations to the case in which material bodies are
in motion in the field. In a really comprehensive and correct theory, as Hertz
remarked, a distinction should be drawn between the quantities
which specify the state of the aether at every point, and those
which specify the state of the ponderable matter entangled with
it. This anticipation has been fulfilled by later investigators ; but Hertz considered that the time was not ripe for such a
complete theory, and preferred, like Maxwell, to assume that
the state of the compound system matter plus aether can be
specified in the same way when the matter moves as when it is at rest ; or, as Hertz himself expressed it, that " the aether
contained within ponderable bodies moves with them."
Maxwell's own hypothesis with regard to moving systemsf
amounted merely to a modification in the equation
B = - curl E,
which represents the law that the electromotive force in a
closed circuit is measured by the rate of decrease in the number
of lines of magnetic induction which pass through the circuit. This law is true whether the circuit is at rest or in motion ; but
in the latter case, the E in the equation must be taken to be the
electromotive force in a stationary circuit whose position
momentarily coincides with that of the moving circuit; and
since an electromotive force [w . B] is generated in matter by
its motion with velocity w in a magnetic field B, we see that Eis connected with the electromotive force E' in the moving
ponderable body by the equation
E' = E + [w . B], so that the equation of electromagnetic induction in the moving
body is B = - curl E' + curl [w . B].

Maxwell made no change in the other electromagneticequations, which therefore retained the customary formsD = f E'/47rc

, div D = 0, 47r(i 4 D) = curl H,
Hertz, however, impressed by the duality of electric andmagnetic phenomena, modified the last of these equationsbyassuming that a magnetic force 4?r [D . w] is generated inadielectric which moves with velocity w in an electric field ; sucha force would be the magnetic analogue of the electromotiveforce of induction. A term involving curl |D . w] is thenintroduced into the last equation.
The theory of Hertz resembles in many respects thatofHeaviside,* who likewise insisted much on the duplex natureof the electromagnetic field, and was in consequence disposedto accept the term involving curl [D . w] in the equationsofmoving media. Heaviside recognized more clearly thanhispredecessors the distinction between the force E', whichdetermines the flux D, and the force E, whose curl representsthe electric current ; and, in conformity with his principleofduality, he made a similar distinction between the magneticforce H', which determines the flux B, and the force H, whosecurl represents the " magnetic current." This distinction,asHeaviside showed, is of importance when the systemisacted on by
" impressed forces," such as voltaic electromotiveforces, or permanent magnetization; these latter mustbeincluded in E' and H', since they help to give rise to the fluxesD and B ; but they must not be included in E and H, since theircurls are not electric or magnetic currents ; so that in generalwe have
E' = E + e, H' = + h,
where e and h denote the impressed forces. Developing the theory by the aid of these conceptions,Heaviside was led to make a further modification. Anim-* Heaviside's general theory was published in a series of papers intheElectrician, from 1885 onwards. His earlier work was republished inhisElectrical Papers (2 vols., 1892), and his Electromagnetic Theory (2 vols., 1894).Mention may be specially made of a memoir in Phil. Trans, clxxxiii (1892),p. 423.
The Followers of Maxwell. 367pressed force is best defined in terms of the energy which it communicates to the system ; thus, if e be an impressed electric
force, the energy communicated to unit volume of the electro- magnetic system in unit time is e x the electric current. In order that this equation may be true, it is necessary to regard the electric current in a moving medium as composed
of the conduction-current, displacement-current, convectioncurrent, and also of the term curl [D . w] , whose presence in the equation we have already noticed. This may be called the current of dielectric convection. Thus the total current is S = D + i + pw + curl [D . w] , where pw denotes the conduction-current ; and the equation
connecting current with magnetic force is curl (H' - h ) = 4?rS,
where h denotes the impressed magnetic forces other than that
induced by motion of the medium.
We must now consider the advances which were effected during the period following the publication of Maxwell's
Treatise in some of the special problems of electricity and
optics.
We have seen* that Maxwell accounted for the rotation of the plane of polarization of light in a medium subjected to a magnetic field K by adding to the kinetic energy of the aether,
which is represented by Jpe*, a term J<r (e . curl 9e/90), where
cr is a magneto-optic constant characteristic of the substance
through which the light is transmitted, and d/dO stands for Kxdl'dx + Kydldy + K-d/dz. This theory was developed further
in 1879 by Fitz Gerald,f who brought it into closer connexion
with the electromagnetic theory of light by identifying the curl
of the displacement e of the aethereal particles with the electric displacement ; the derivate of e with respect to the time then
corresponds to the magnetic force. Being thus in possession of a definitely electromagnetic theory of the magnetic rotation of * Cf. p. 308. t Phil. Trans., 1879, p. 691. Fitz Gerald's Scient. Writings, p. 45.

light, Fitz Gerald proceeded to extend it so as to take accountof a closely related phenomenon. In 1876 J. Kerr* had shownexperimentally that when plane-polarized light is regularlyreflected from either pole of an iron electromagnet, the reflectedray has a component polarized in a plane at right angles totheordinary reflected ray. Shortly after this discovery had beenmade known, Fitz Geraldf had proposed to explain it by meansof the same term in the equations which accounts for the magnetic rotation of light in transparent bodies. His argumentwasthat if the incident plane-polarized ray be resolved into tworays circularly polarized in opposite senses, the refractive indexwill have different values for these two rays, and hencetheintensities after reflexion will be different; so that onre-compounding them, two plane-polarized rays will be obtainedone polarized in the plane of incidence, and the other polarizedat right angles to it. The analytical discussion of Kerr's phenomenon, whichwasgiven by Fitz Gerald in his memoir of 1879, was based on theseideas ; the most essential features of the phenomenonwereexplained, but the investigation was in some respects imperfect.}Anew and fruitful conception was introduced in 1879-1880,when H. A. Eowland suggested a connexion betweenthemagnetic rotation of light and the phenomenon which hadbeendiscovered by his pupil Hall.|| Hall's effect may be regarded* Phil. Mag. (5) iii (1877), p. 321.

as a rotation of conduction-currents under the influence of a magnetic field ; and if it be assumed that displacement-currents
in dielectrics are rotated in the same way, the Faraday effect may evidently be explained. Considering the matter from the
analytical point of view, the Hall effect may be represented by
the addition of a term k [K . S] to the electromotive force,
where K denotes the impressed magnetic force, and S denotes
the current : so Kowland assumed that in dielectrics there is an
additional term in the electric force, proportional to [K . D], i.e. proportional to the rate of increase of [K . D]. Now it is universally true that the total electric force round a circuit is proportional to the rate of decrease of the total magnetic
induction through the circuit : so the total magnetic induction
through the circuit must contain a term proportional to the
integral of [K . D] taken round the circuit : and therefore the
magnetic induction at any point must contain a term proportional
to curl [K . D]. We may therefore write
B = H + a curl [K . D],
where <r denotes a constant. But if this be combined with the
customary electromagnetic equations
curl H = 47rD, curl E = - B, D =
eE/47rc

, and all the vectors except B be eliminated (K being treated
as a constant), we obtain the equation
B -

2B + O/47r) curl where 3/80 stands for (Kxd/fa + Kyd/dy + Kzd/dz) ; and this is identical with the equation which Maxwell had given* for the
motion of the aether in magnetized media. It follows that the
assumptions of Maxwell and of Eowland, different though they
are physically, lead to the same analytical equations at any
rate so far as concerns propagation through a homogeneous
medium.

The allied phenomenon of rotary polarization in naturallyactive bodies was investigated in 1892 by Goldhammer.fIt* The theory of Basset (Phil. Trans, clxxxii (1891), p. 371) was, like Rowland's,based on the idea of extending Hall's phenomenon to dielectric media. Anobjection to this theory was that the tangential component of the electromotive forcewas not continuous across the interface between a magnetized and an unmagnetizedmedium ; but Basset subsequently overcame this difficulty (Nature, Hi (1 895), p. 618;liii (1895), p. 130; Amer. Jour. Math, xix (1897), p. 60) the effect analogoustoHall's being introduced into the equation connecting electric displacementwithelectric force, so that the equation took the form E = (47rc

will be remembered* that in the elastic-solid theory of Boussinesq, the rotation of the plane of polarization of saccharine solutions had been represented by substituting the
equation
e' = Ae + B curl e in place of the usual equation
e' = Ae. Goldhammer now proposed to represent rotatory power in the
electromagnetic theory by substituting the equation
E =
(4ircVO D + k curl D,
in place of the customary equation
E = (4ircVO D : the constant k being a measure of the natural rotatory power
of the substance concerned. The remaining equations are as
usual. curl H = 47rD, - curl E = H
Eliminating H and E, we have

In the closing years of the nineteenth century, the general
theory of aether and electricity assumed a new form. But
before discussing the memoirs in which the new conception was
unfolded, we shall consider the progress which had been madesince the middle of the century in the study of conduction in liquid and gaseous media.

CONDUCTION IN SOLUTIONS AND GASES, FROM FARADAY TOJ. J. THOMSON.
THE hypothesis which Grothuss and Davy had advanced*toexplain the decomposition of electrolytes was open to seriousobjection in more than one respect. Since the electric forcewas supposed first to dissociate the molecules of the electrolyteinto ions, and afterwards to set them in motion towardtheelectrodes, it would seem reasonable to expect that doublingthe electric force would double both the dissociation of themolecules and the velocity of the ions, and would thereforequadruple the electrolysis an inference which is not verifiedby observation. Moreover it might be expected, on Grothuss'theory, that some definite magnitude of electromotive forcewould be requisite for the dissociation, and that no electrolysisat all would take place when the electromotive force was belowthis value, which again is contrary to experience.
A way of escape from these difficulties was first indicated,in1850, by Alex. Williamson,-)- who suggested that in compoundliquids decompositions and recombinations of the moleculesarecontinually taking place throughout the whole mass of the liquid,quite independently of the application of an external electricforce. An atom of one element in the compound is thus pairednow with one and now with another atom of another element,and in the intervals between these alliances the atom mayberegarded as entirely free. In 1857 this idea was madeby* Cf. p. 78. f Phil. Mag. xxxvii (1850), p. 350 ; Liebig's Annulen d. Chem. u. Pharni.Ixxvii (1851) p. 37.
Conduction in Solutions and Gase*, etc. 373K. Clausius,* of Zurich, the basis of a theory of electrolysis.
According to it, the electromotive force emanating from the
electrodes does not effect the dissociation of the electrolyte into ions, since a degree of dissociation sufficient for the purpose
already exists in consequence of the perpetual mutability of the
molecules of the electrolyte. Clausius assumed that these ions are in opposite electric conditions; the applied electric force therefore causes a general drift of all the ions of one kind
towards the anode, and of all the ions of the other kind towards
the cathode. These opposite motions of the two kinds of ions
constitute the galvanic current in the liquid.
The merits of the Williamson-Clausius hypothesis were not
fully recognized for many years ; but it became the foundation
of that theory of electrolysis which was generally accepted at the end of the century.
Meanwhile another aspect of electrolysis was receiving
attention. It had long been known that the passage of a
current through an electrolytic solution is attended not only
by the appearance of the products of decomposition at the
electrodes, but also by changes of relative strength in different parts of the solution itself. Thus in the electrolysis of a solution
of copper sulphate, with copper electrodes, in which copper is dissolved off the anode and deposited on the cathode, it is found
that the concentration of the solution diminishes near the
cathode, and increases near the anode. Some experiments on
the subject were made by Faradayf in 1835 ; and in 1844 it was further investigated by Frederic Daniell and W. A. Miller,J who explained it by asserting that the cation and anion have
not (as had previously been supposed) the same facility of moving to their respective electrodes ; but that in many cases the cation appears to move but little, while the transport is effected chiefly by the anion.

374 Conduction in Solutions and Gases,
This idea was adopted by W. Hittorf, of Minister, who, in theyears 1853 to 1859, published* a series of memoirs onthemigration of the ions. Let the velocity of the anions in thesolution be to the velocity of the cations in the ratio v : u.Then it is easily seen that if (u + v) molecules of the electrolyteare decomposed by the current, and yielded up as ions attheelectrodes, v of these molecules will have been taken fromthefluid on the side of the cathode, and u of them from the fluidon the side of the anode. By measuring the concentrationofthe liquid round the electrodes after the passage of a current,Hittorf determined the ratio v/u in a large number of casesofelectrolysis.!
The theory of ionic movements was advanced a furtherstage by F. W. KohlrauschJ (I. 1840, d. 1910), of Wurzburg.Kohlrausch showed that although the ohmic specific conductivity k of a solution diminishes indefinitely as the strengthof the solution is reduced, yet the ratio k/m, where mdenotesthe number of gramme-equivalents of salt per unit volume, tendsto a definite limit, when the solution is indefinitely dilute. Thislimiting value may be denoted by A. He further showedthatA may be expressed as the sum of two parts, one of whichdepends on the cation, but is independent of the nature oftheanion; while the other depends on the anion, but not onthecation a fact which may be explained by supposing that,invery dilute solutions, the twos ions move independently underthe influence of the electric force. Let u and v denotethevelocities of the cation and anion respectively, whenthepotential difference per cm. in the solution is unity : thenthetotal current carried through a cube of unit volume is mE(u+v),where E denotes the electric charge carried by one gramme-# Ann. d. Phys. Ixxxix (1853), p. 177 ; xcviii (1856), p. 1 ; ciii (1858), p.1;cvi (1859), pp. 337, 513. t The ratio v/(u + v) was termed by Hittorf the transport, number of the anion.J Ann d. Phys. vi (1879), pp. 1, 145. The chief results had been communicatedto the Academy of Gottingen in 1876 and 1877.

from experimental data. Meanwhile, important advances in voltaic theory were
being effected in connexion with a different class of investi- gations.
Suppose that two mercury electrodes are placed in a solution
of acidulated water, and that a difference of potential, insufficient to produce continuous decomposition of the water, is set up
between the electrodes by an external agency. Initially a
slight electric current the polarizing current,f as it is called
is observed; but after a short time it ceases; and after its cessation
the state of the system is one of electrical equilibrium. It is evident that the polarizing current must in some way have set up in the cell an electromotive force equal and opposite to the
external difference of potential ; and it is also evident that the
seat of this electromotive force must be at the electrodes, which
are now said to be polarized.
An abrupt fall of electric potential at an interface between
two media, such as the mercury and the solution in the present
case, requires that there should be a field of electric force, of considerable intensity, within a thin stratum at the interface > and this must owe its existence to the presence of electric charges. Since there is no electric field outside the thin stratum,
there must be as much vitreous as resinous electricity present ; but the vitreous charges must preponderate on one side of the
stratum, and the resinous charges on the other side ; so that
the system as a whole resembles the two coatings of a con- denser with the intervening dielectric. In the case of the
* i.e. E is 96580 coulombs. t The phenomenon of voltaic polarization was discovered by Hitter in 1803.
Hitter explained it by comparing the action of the polarizing current to that of a
current which is used to charge a condenser. Volta in 1805 put forward the
alternative explanation, that the products of decomposition set tip a reverse electromotive force.
376 Conduction in Solutions and Gases,
polarized mercury cathode in acidulated water, there mustbeon the electrode itself a negative charge : the surface of thiselectrode in the polarized state may be supposed to be eithermercury, or mercury covered with a layer of hydrogen. Inthe solution adjacent to the electrode, there must be an excessof cations and a deficiency of anions, so as to constitute theother layer of the condenser : these cations may be eithermercury cations dissolved from the electrode, or the hydrogencations of the'solution.
It was shown in 1870 by Cromwell Fleetwood Varley*thata mercury cathode, thus polarized in acidulated water, showsatendency to adopt a definite superficial form, as if the surface-tension at the interface between the mercury and the solutionwere in some way dependent on the electric conditions. Thematter was more fully investigated in 1873 by a youngFrench physicist, then preparing for his inaugural thesis,Gabriel Lippmann.f In Lippmann's instrumental disposition,which is called a capillary electrometer, mercury electrodes areimmersed in acidulated water : the anode HQ has a largesurface, wkile^the cathode H has a variable surface S smallincomparison. When the external electromotive force is applied,it is easily seen that the fall of potential at the large electrodeis only slightly affected, while the fall of potential at the smallelectrode is altered by polarization by an amount practicallyequal to the external electromotive force. Lippmann foundthat the constant of capillarity of the interface at the smallelectrode was a function of the external electromotive force, andtherefore of the difference of potential between the mercuryand the electrolyte.
Let V denote the external electromotive force: we may,without loss of generality, assume the potential of [ to be zero,so that the potential of H is - V. The state of the system maybe varied by altering either V or /S; we assume that these* Phil. Trans, clxi (1871), p. 129. f Comptes Rendus Ixxvi (1873), p. 1407. Phil.

isothermally, and that the state of the large electrode H,} is not
altered thereby. Let de denote the quantity of electricity which
passes through the cell from 5" to H, when the state of the
system is thus varied : then if E denote the available energy of the system, and y the surface-tension at H, we have
dE = ydS + Vde,
y being measured by the work required to increase the surface
when no electricity flows through the circuit. In order that equilibrium may be re-established between the
electrode and the solution when the fall of potential at the
cathode is altered, it will be necessary not only that some
hydrogen cations should come out of the solution and be
deposited on the electrode, yielding up their charges, but also that there should be changes in the clustering of the charged
ions of hydrogen, mercury, and sulphion in the layer of the
solution immediately adjacent to the electrode. Each of these
circumstances necessitates a flow of electricity in the outer
circuit : in the one case to neutralize the charges of the cations
deposited, and in the other case to increase the surface-density
of electric charge on the electrode, which forms the opposite
sheet of the quasi-condenser. Let Sf (V) denote the total quantity of electricity which has thus flowed in the circuit when the external electromotive force has attained the value V. Then evidently
so dE= {y+ Vf(V)\dS + VSf (V}dV.
Since this expression must be an exact differential, we have
so that -
dy/d V is equal to that flux of electricity per unit of new surface formed, which will maintain the surface in a
378 Conduction in Solutions and Gases,
constant condition (V being constant) when it is extended.Integrating the previous equation, we have
Lippmann found that when the external electromotive forcewas applied, the surface-tension increased at first, until, whenthe external electromotive force amounted to about one volt,the surface-tension attained a maximum value, after whichitdiminished. He found that d-y/d F
2 was sensibly independentof F, so that the curve which represents the relation between7 and F is a parabola.*
The theory so far is more or less independent of assumptionsas to what actually takes place at the electrode : on this latterquestion many conflicting views have been put forward. In1878 Josiah Willard Gibbs,t of Yale (b. 1839, d. 1903), discussedthe problem on the supposition that the polarizing currentissimply an ordinary electrolytic conduction-current, whichcauses a liberation of hydrogen from the ionic form at thecathode. If this be so, the amount of electricity which passesthrough the cell in any displacement must be proportionaltothe quantity of hydrogen which is yielded up to the electrodein the displacement; so that dy/dV must be proportionaltothe amount of hydrogen deposited per unit area of theelectrode.:}: A different view of the physical conditions at the polarizedelectrode was taken by Helmholtz, who assumed that the ionsof hydrogen which are brought to the cathode by the polarizingcurrent do not give up their charges there, but remain in thevicinity of the electrode, and form one face of a quasi-condenser* Lippman, Coniptes Eendus, xcv (1882), p. 686. t Trans.

of which the other face is the electrode itself.* If a denote
the surface-density of electricity on either face of this quasicondenser, we have, therefore, de = -
d(Sa) ; so a =
dyfd V. This equation shows that when dyldV is zero i.e., when
the surface-tension is a maximum a must be zero ; that is to
say, there must be no difference of potential between the
mercury and the electrolyte. The external electromotive force
is then balanced entirely by the discontinuity of potential at the other electrode J7" ; and thus a method is suggested of measuring the latter discontinuity of potential. All previous
measurements of differences of potential had involved the
employment of more than one interface ; and it was not knownhow the measured difference of potential should be distributed
among these interfaces ; so that the suggestion of a means of measuring single differences of potential was a distinct advance, even though the hypotheses on which the method was based were somewhat insecure. A further consequence deduced by Helmholtz from this theory leads to a second method of determining the difference
of potential between mercury and an electrolyte. If a mercury
surface is rapidly extending, and electricity is not rapidly
transferred through the electrolyte, the electric surface-density
in the double layer must rapidly decrease, since the same
quantity of electricity is being distributed over an increasing
area. Thus it may be inferred that a rapidly extending
mercury-surface in an electrolyte is at the same potential as the electrolyte.
This conception is realized in the dropping-electrode, in
* The conception of double layers of electricity at the surface of separation of two bodies had been already applied by Helmholtz to explain various other phenomena e.g., the Volta contact-difference of potential of two metals, fiictional
electricity, and *' electric endosmose," or the transport of fluid which occurs when
an electric current is passed through two conducting liquids separated by a porous
barrier. Cf. Helmholtz, Berlin Monatsberichte, February 27, 1879 ; -Ann. d. Phys.

According to Helmholtz'sconclusion there is no difference of potential betweenthedrops and the electrolyte ; and therefore the differenceofpotential between the electrolyte and a layer of mercuryunderlying it in the same vessel is equal to the differenceofpotential between this layer of mercury and the mercuryin the upper reservoir, which difference is a measurablequantity.
It will be seen that according to the theories both of Gibbsand of Helmholtz, and indeed according to all other theoriesonthe subject,* d^ldV is zero for an electrode whose surfaceis*
E.g., that of Warburg, Ann. d. Phys. xli (1890), p. 1. In this it is assumedthat the electrolytic solution near the electrodes originally contains a saltofmercury in solution. When the external electromotive force is applied, a conduction-current passes through the electrolyte, which in the hody of the electrolyteis carried by the acid and hydrogen ions. Warburg supposed that at thecathode the hydrogen ions react with the salt of mercury, reducing it to metallicmercury, which is deposited on the electrode. Thus a considerable changeinconcentration of the salt of mercury is caused at the cathode. At the anode,theacid ions carrying the current attack the mercury of the electrode, and thusincrease the local concentration of the mercuric salt ; but on account of the sizeofthe anode this increase is trivial and may be neglected. Warburg thus supposed that the electromotive force of the polarized cellisreally that of a concentration cell, depending on the different concentrationsofmercuric salt at the electrodes. He found dy/dV to be equal to the amountofmercuric salt at the cathode per unit area of cathode, divided by the electro-chemical equivalent of mercury. The equation previously obtained is thuspresented in a new physical interpretation. Warburg connected the increase of the surface-tension with the fact that thesurface-tension between mercury and a solution always increases when the concentration of the solution is diminished. His theory, of course, leads to noconclusion regarding the absolute potential difference between the mercury andthesolution, as Helmholtz' does. Alan electrode whose surface is rapidly increasing e.g., a dropping electrodeWarburg supposed that the surface-density of mercuric salt tends to zero,sodyldV is zero. The explanation of dropping electrodes favoured by Nernst, Beilage zu denAnn. d. Phys. Iviii (1896), is that the difference of potential corresponding to theequilibrium between the mercury and the electrolyte is instantaneouslyestablished ; but that ions are withdrawn from the solution in order to formthedouble layer necessary for this, and that these ions are carried down with the drops

rapidly increasing e.g., a dropping electrode; that is to say, the difference of potential between an ordinary mercury
electrode and the electrolyte, when the surface-tension has its maximum value, is equal to the difference of potential between
a dropping-electrode and the same electrolyte. This result has
been experimentally verified by various investigators, who have
shown that the applied electromotive force when the surface- tension has its maximum value in the capillary electrometer, is equal to the electromotive force of a cell having as electrodes a
large mercury electrode and a dropping electrode. Another memoir which belongs to the same period of Helmholtz' career, and which has led to important developments, was concerned with a special class of voltaic cells. The
most usual type of cell is that in which the positive electrode
is composed of a different metal from the negative electrode,
and the evolution of energy depends on the difference in the
chemical affinities of these metals for the liquids in the cell. But in the class of cells now considered* by Helmholtz, the
two electrodes are composed of the same metal (say, copper) ; and the liquid (say, solution of copper sulphate) is more con- centrated in the neighbourhood of one electrode than in the
neighbourhood of the other. When the cell is in operation, the
salt passes from the places of high concentration to the places
of low concentration, so as to equalize its distribution ; and this process is accompanied by the flow of a current in the outer
circuit between the electrodes. Such cells had been studied
experimentally by James Moser a short time previously! to Helmholtz' investigation.
The activity of the cell is due to the fact that the available
energy of a solution depends on its concentration ; the molecules
of mercury, until the upper layer of the solution is so much impoverished that the double layer can no longer be formed. The impoverishment of the upper layer of the solution has actually been observed by Palniaer, Zeitsch. Phys. Chem. xxv

of salt, in passing from a high to a low concentration,aretherefore capable of supplying energy, just as a compressedgasis capable of supplying energy when its degree of compressionis reduced. To examine the matter quantitatively, let nf(nfV)denote the term in the available energy of a solution, whichisdue to the dissolution of n gramme-molecules of salt in a volumeV of pure solvent ; the function / will of course depend alsoonthe temperature. Then when dn gramme-molecules of solventare evaporated from the solution, the decrease in the availableenergy of the system is evidently equal to the available energyofdn gramme-molecules of liquid solvent, less the available energyof dn gramme-molecules of the vapour of the solvent, togetherwith nf(n/ V) less nf{n/(V-v dn) } , where v denotes the volumeof one gramme-molecule of the liquid. But this decreaseinavailable energy must be equal to the mechanical work suppliedto the external world, which is dn . p (v -
v), if pl denotethevapour-pressure of the solution at the temperature in question,and v denote the volume of one gramme-molecule of vapour.We have therefore
dn . pi (v' - v) = available energy of dn gramme-moleculesofsolvent vapour + available energy of dn gramme-moleculesofliquid solvent + nf(n/ V) - nf {n/( V-v dn) \ . Subtracting from this the equation obtained by making nzero,we have
dn . (Pi - p ) (v -
v) =
nf(n/ V) -
nf( n/( V - v dn) } , where pQ denotes the vapour-pressure of the pure solvent atthetemperature in question ; so that
(Pi -Po) <>' -

(n'/V*)f(n/V)v.
Now, it is known that when a salt is dissolved in water,thevapour-pressure is lowered in proportion to the concentrationof the salt at any rate when the concentration is small: in

Neglecting v in comparison with v', and making use of the
equation of state of perfect gases (namely,
pjt = ST.
where T denotes the absolute temperature, and R denotes the constant of the equation of state), we have
and therefore
Thus in the available energy of one gramme-molecule of a
dissolved salt, the term which depends on the concentration is proportional to the logarithm of the concentration ; and hence,
if in a concentration-cell one gramme-molecule of the salt passes from a high concentration c2 at one electrode to a low
concentration GI at the other electrode, its available energy is thereby diminished by an amount proportional to log (c2/c,). The energy which thus disappears is given up by the system in the form of electrical work; and therefore the electromotive
force of the concentration-cell must be proportional to log (Cz/cJ.. The theory of solutions and their vapour-pressure wasnot at the time sufficiently developed to enable Helmholtz
to determine precisely the coefficient of log (c2/Ci) in the
expression.*
An important advance in the theory of solutions was effected in 1887, by a young Swedish physicist, Svante Arrhenius.f
* The formula given by Helmholtz was that the electromotive force of the cell
is equal to b(l -

one gramme-equivalent of salt is dissolved in q grammes of water, where q denotes
a large number.

384 Conduction in Solutions and Gases,
Interpreting the properties discovered by Kohlrausch* in thelight of the ideas of Williamson and Clausius regardingthespontaneous dissociation of electrolytes, Arrhenius inferred thatin very dilute solutions the electrolyte is completely dissociatedinto ions, but that in more concentrated solutions the saltisless completely dissociated; and that as in all solutions thetransport of electricity in the solution is effected solely bythemovement of ions, the equivalent conductivityf must be proportional to the fraction which expresses the degree of ionization.By aid of these conceptions it became possible to estimatethedissociation quantitatively, and to construct a general theoryof electrolytes.
Contemporary physicists and chemists found it difficultat first to believe that a salt exists in dilute solution onlyin the form of ions, e.g. that the sodium and chlorine existseparately and independently in a solution of commonsalt.But there is a certain amount of chemical evidence in favourof Arrhenius' conception. For instance, the tests in chemicalanalysis are really tests for the ions ; iron in the form of a fer-rocyanide, and chlorine in the form of a chlorate, do not respondto the characteristic tests for iron and chlorine respectively,which are really the tests for the iron and chlorine ions. The general acceptance of Arrhenius' views was hastenedby the advocacy of Ostwald, who brought to light furtherevidence in their favour. For instance, all permanganatesin dilute solution show the same purple colour; andOstwald considered their absorption-spectra to be identical;Jthis identity is easily accounted for on Arrhenius' theory,bysupposing that the spectrum in question is that of the anionwhich corresponds to the acid radicle. The blue colourwhich is observed in dilute solutions of copper salts, evenwhen the strong solution is not blue, may in the same waybe* Cf. p. 374. t I.e. the ohmic specific conductivity of the solution divided by the numberofgramme-equivalents of salt per unit volume.

from Faraday to J .J. Thomson. 385ascribed to a blue copper cation. A striking instance of the same kind is afforded by ferric sulphocyanide ; here the strong
solution shows a deep red colour, due to the salt itself ; but on
dilution the colour disappears, the ions being colourless. If it be granted that ions can have any kind of permanent
existence in a salt solution, it may be shown from thermodynamical considerations that the degree of dissociation must
increase as the dilution increases, and that at infinite dilution
there must be complete dissociation. For the available energy
of a dilute solution of volume V, containing j gramme-molecules
of one substance, >/ 2 gramme-molecules of another, and so on, is (as may be shown by an obvious extension of the reasoning
already employed in connexion with concentration-cells)*
r (T) + RT^nr log (UT! V) + the available energy

where r (T) depends on T and on the nature of the r

Applying this to the case of an electrolyte in which the

Since in a neutral solution the number of anions is equal tothenumber of cations, this equation may be written
nf = Fw-i x a function of T only ;
it shows that when V is very large (so that the solution is verydilute), n2 is very large compared with n^ ; that is to say,thesalt tends towards a state of complete dissociation. The ideas of Arrhenius contributed to the success of WaltherNernst* in perfecting Helmholtz' theory of concentration-cells,and representing their mechanism in a much more definitefashion than had been done heretofore. In an electrolytic solution let the drift-velocity of thecations under unit electric force be u, and that of the anionsbe vt so that the fraction uj(u + v} of the current is transportedby the cations, and the fraction v/(u + v) by the anions. Iftheconcentration of the solution be Cj at one electrode, and c2 attheother, it follows from the formula previously found fortheavailable energy that one gramme
- ion of cations, in movingfrom one electrode to the other, is capable of yielding upanamountf RT log (c2/c,) of energy; while one gramme- ionof anions going in the opposite direction must absorb the sameamount of energy. The total quantity of work furnished whenone gramme-molecule of salt is transferred from concentrationct to concentration c { is therefore

is d, be in contact with a dilute solution of zinc sulphate, andlet this in turn be in contact with a quantity of zinc amalgamof concentration cz . When the two masses of amalgam are con- nected by a conducting wire outside the cell, an electric current
flows in the wire from the weak to the strong amalgam,* while
zinc cations pass through the solution from the strong amalgamto the weak. The electromotive force of such a cell, in which
the current may be supposed to be carried solely by cations, is RT. c, loV Not content with the derivation of the electromotive force from considerations of energy, Nernst proceeded to supply a
definite mechanical conception of the process of conduction in
electrolytes. The ions are impelled by the electric force asso- ciated with the gradient of potential in the electrolyte. Butthis is not the only force which acts on them ; for, since their available energy decreases as the concentration decreases, there
must be a force assisting every process by which the concentration is decreased. The matter may be illustrated by the analogy
of a gas compressed in a cylinder fitted with a piston; the
available energy of the gas decreases as its degree of compression
decreases; and therefore that movement of the piston which
tends to decrease the compression is assisted by a force the
"pressure" of the gas on the piston. Similarly, if a solution were contained within a cylinder fitted with a piston which is permeable to the pure solvent but not to the solute, and if the
whole were immersed in pure solvent, the available energy of

the system would be decreased if the piston were to moveoutwards so as to admit more solvent into the solution; andtherefore this movement of the piston would be assisted byaforce the "osmotic pressure of the solution," as it is called.*Consider, then, the case of a single electrolyte supposedtobe perfectly dissociated ; its state will be supposed to bethesame at all points of any plane at right angles to the axis ofx.Let v denote the valency of the ions, and Vthe electric potentialat any point. Sincef the available energy of a given quantityofa substance in very dilute solution depends on the concentrationin exactly the same way as the available energy of a givenquantity of a perfect gas depends on its density, it follows thatthe osmotic pressure p for each ion is determined in termsofthe concentration and temperature by the equation of stateof perfect gases

It may be remarked that although the current arising from
a concentration cell which is kept at a constant temperature is capable of performing work, yet this work is provided, not by
any diminution in the total internal energy of the cell, but by
the abstraction of thermal energy from neighbouring bodies. This indeed (as may be seen by reference to W. Thomson's general

equation of available energy)* must be the case with anysystem whose available energy is exactly proportional to theabsolute temperature.
The advances which were effected in the last quarter of thenineteenth century in regard to the conduction of electricitythrough liquids, considerable though these advances were, maybe regarded as the natural development of a theory whichhadlong been before the world. It was otherwise with the kindredproblem of the conduction of electricity through gases : foralthough many generations of philosophers had studied theremarkable effects which are presented by the passage ofacurrent through a rarefied gas, it was not until recent timesthat a satisfactory theory of the phenomena was discovered.Some of the electricians of the earlier part of the eighteenthcentury performed experiments in vacuous spaces ; in particular,Hauksbeef in 1705 observed a luminosity when glass is rubbedin rarefied air. But the first investigator of the continuousdischarge through a Tarefied gas seems to have been Watson,!who, by means of an electrical machine, sent a current throughan exhausted glass tube three feet long and three inchesindiameter. " It was," he wrote,
" a most delightful spectacle,when the room was darkened, to see the electricity in itspassage : to be able to observe not, as in the open air, itsbrushes or pencils of rays an inch or two in length, but herethe coruscations were of the whole length of the tube betweenthe plates, that is to say, thirty-two inches." Its appearancehe described as being on different occasions "
of a bright silverhue,"
" resembling very much the most lively coruscationsofthe aurora borealis," and " forming a continued arch of lambentflame." His theoretical explanation was that the electricity

from Faraday to J. J. Thomson. 391equilibrium in the machine " a conception which follows naturally from the combination of Watson's one-fluid theory
with the prevalent doctrine of electrical atmospheres.*
A different explanation was put forward by Nollet, whoperformed electrical experiments in rarefied air at about the same time as Watson,f and saw in them a striking confirmation
of his own hypothesis of efflux and afflux of electric matter.J According to Nollet, the particles of the effluent stream collide with those of the affluent stream which is moving in the
opposite direction ; and being thus violently shaken, are excited
to the point of emitting light.
Almost a century elapsed before anything more was dis- covered regarding the discharge in vacuous spaces. But in 1838 Faraday, while passing a current from the electrical machine between two brass rods in rarefied air, noticed that
the purple haze or stream of light which proceeded from the
positive pole stopped short before it arrived at the negative
rod. The negative rod, which was itself covered with a con- tinuous glow, was thus separated from the purple column bya narrow dark space: to this, in honour of its discoverer,
the name Faraday's dark space has generally been given bysubsequent writers. That vitreous and resinous electricity give rise to different types of discharge had long been known; and indeed, as wehave seen,) | it was the study of these differences that led
Franklin to identify the electricity of glass with the superfluity of
fluid, and the electricity of amber with the deficiency of it. Butphenomena of this class are in general much more complex
than might be supposed from the appearance which they
present at a first examination ; and the value of Faraday's
discovery of the negative glow and dark space lay chiefly in the simple and definite character of these features of the
discharge, which indicated them as promising subjects for further research. Faraday himself felt the importance of

investigations in this direction. " The results connected withthe different conditions of positive and negative discharge,"hewrote,*
" will have a far greater influence on the philosophyofelectrical science than we at present imagine."
Twenty more years, however, passed before another notableadvance was made. That a subject so full of promise shouldprogress so slowly may appear strange ; but one reason at anyrate is to be found in the incapacity of the air-pumps theninuse to rarefy gases to the degree required for effective studyof the negative glow. The invention of Geissler's mercurialair-pump in 1855 did much to remove this difficulty; anditwas in Geissler's exhausted tubes that Julius Plticker,t of Bonn,studied the discharge three years later. It had been shown by Sir Humphrey Davy in 1821J thatone form of electric discharge namely, the arc between carbonpoles is deflected when a magnet is brought near toit.Pliicker now performed a similar experiment with the vacuumdischarge, and observed a similar deflexion. But the mostinteresting of his results were obtained by examiningthebehaviour of the negative glow in the magnetic field ; whenthe negative electrode was reduced to a single point, the wholeof the negative light became concentrated along the lineofmagnetic force passing through this point. In other words,the negative glow disposed itself as if it were constitutedofflexible chains of iron filings attached at one end to thecathode.
Pliicker noticed that when the cathode was of platinum,small particles were torn off it and deposited on the wallsofthe glass bulb. " It is most natural," he wrote,
" to imaginethat the magnetic light is formed by the incandescence of theseplatinum particles as they are torn from the negative electrode."He likewise observed that during the discharge the wallsof* Exper. Res., 1523.

from Faraday to J. J. Thomson. 393the tube, near the cathode, glowed with a phosphorescent light,
and remarked that the position of this light was altered whenthe magnetic field was changed. This led to another discovery ; for in 1869 Plucker's pupil, W. Hittorf,* having placed a solid body between a point-cathode and the phosphorescent light, wassurprised to find that a shadow was cast. He rightly inferred
from this that the negative glow is formed of rays which
proceed from the cathode in straight lines, and which cause the
phosphorescence when they strike the walls of the tube.
Hittorf's observation was amplified in 1876 by EugenGoldstein,f who found that distinct shadows were cast, not
only when the cathode was a single point, but also when it formed an extended surface, provided the shadow-throwing
object was placed close to it. This clearly showed that the
cathode rays (a term now for the first time introduced) are not emitted indiscriminately in all directions, but that each portion
of the cathode surface emits rays which are practically confined
to a single direction ; and Goldstein found this direction to be
normal to the surface. In this respect his discovery established an important distinction between the manner in which cathode
rays are emitted from an electrode and that in which light is emitted from an incandescent surface. The question as to the nature of the cathode rays attracted
much attention during the next two decades. In the year
following Hittorf's investigation, Cromwell VarleyJ put forward
the hypothesis that the rays are composed of " attenuated particles of matter, projected from the negative pole by electricity" ; and that it is in virtue of their negative charges that these
particles are influenced by a magnetic field. During some years following this, the properties of highly

rarefied gases were investigated by Sir William Crookes.Influenced, doubtless, by the ideas which were developedinconnexion with his discovery of the radiometer, Crookes,* likeVarley, proposed to regard the cathode rays as a moleculartorrent : he supposed the molecules of the residual gas, cominginto contact with the cathode, to acquire from it a resinous charge,and immediately to fly off normally to the surface, by reasonofthe mutual repulsion exerted by similarly electrified bodies.Carrying the exhaustion to a higher degree, Crookes was enabledto study a dark space which under such circumstances appearsbetween the cathode and the cathode glow ; and to show thatatthe highest rarefactions this dark space (which has since been generally known by his name) enlarges until the whole tube is occupiedby it. He suggested that the thickness of the dark space maybe a measure of the mean length of free path of the molecules." The extra velocity," he wrote,
" with which the moleculesrebound from the excited negative pole keeps back the moreslowly moving molecules which are advancing towards that pole.The conflict occurs at the boundary of the dark space, wheretheluminous margin bears witness to the energy of the collisions."fThus according to Crookes the dark space is dark andtheglow bright because there are collisions in the latter and notinthe former. The fluorescence or phosphorescence on the wallsof the tube he attributed to the impact of the particles onthe glass.
Crookes spoke of the cathode rays as an
" ultra-gaseous
"or" fourth state "
of matter. These expressions have led somelater writers to ascribe to him the enunciation or predictionofa hypothesis regarding the nature of the particles projected fromthe cathode, which arose some years afterwards, and whichweshall presently describe ; but it is clear from Crookes' memoirsthat he conceived the particles of the cathode rays to beordinary gaseous molecules, carrying electric charges ; andby* Phil. Trans, clxx (1879), pp. 135, 641 ; Phil. Mag. vii (1879), p. 57. t Phil. Mag. vii (1879), p. 57.
from Faraday to J. J. 71wmson. 395" a new state of matter " he understood simply a state in whichthe free path is so long that collisions may be disregarded.
Crookes found that two adjacent pencils of cathode rays
appeared to repel each other. At the time this was regarded as a direct confirmation of the hypothesis that the rays are streamsof electrically charged particles ; but it was shown later that
the deflexion of the rays must be assigned to causes other thanmutual repulsion.
How admirably the molecular-torrent theory accounts for the deviation of the cathode rays by a magnetic field was shownby the calculations of Eduard Riecke in 1881.* If the axis of
z be taken parallel to the magnetic force Ht the equations of motion of a particle of mass ra, charge e, and velocity (u, v, w)are mdu/dt = evH, mdvjdt = - euH, mdw/dt = 0. The last equation shows that the component of velocity of the
particle parallel to the magnetic force is constant; the other
equations give u = A sin (eHt/m), v = A cos (eHi/m),
showing that the projection of the path on a plane at right
angles to the magnetic force is a circle. Thus, in a magneticfield the particles of the molecular torrent describe spiral paths
whose axes are the lines of magnetic force. But the hypothesis of Varley and Crookes was before long
involved in difficulties. Taitf in 1880 remarked that if the
particles are moving with great velocities, the periods of the
luminous vibrations received from them should be affected to a measurable extent in accordance with Doppler's principle.
Tait tried to obtain this effect, but without success. It may,however, be argued that if, as Crookes supposed, the particles
become luminous only when they have collided with other
particles, and have thereby lost part of their velocity, the
phenomenon in question is not to be expected.

396 Conduction in Solutions and Gases, The alternative to the molecular-torrent theory is to supposethat the cathode radiation is a disturbance of the aether. Thisview was maintained by several physicists,* and notablybyHertz,f who rejected Varley's hypothesis when he foundexperimentally that the rays did not appear to produce anyexternal electric or magnetic force, and were apparently notaffected by an electrostatic field. It was, however, pointedout by Fitz Gerald* that external space is probably screenedfrom the effects of the rays by other electric actions whichtake place in the discharge tube.
It was further urged against the charged-particle theorythat cathode rays are capable of passing through films of metalwhich are so thick as to be quite opaque to ordinary light; it seemed inconceivable that particles of matter should notbestopped by even the thinnest gold-leaf. At the time of Hertz'sexperiments on the subject, an attempt to obviate this difficultywas made by J.-J. Thomson,! | who suggested that the metallicfilm when bombarded by the rays might itself acquire theproperty of emitting charged particles, so that the rays whichwere observed on the further side need not have passed throughthe film. It was Thomson who ultimately found the trueexplanation ; but this depended in part on another orderofideas, whose introduction and development must nowbetraced. The tendency, which was now general, to abandon theelectron-theory of Weber in favour of Maxwell's theoryinvolved certain changes in the conceptions of electric charge.* E.g. E. Wiedemann, Ann. d. Phys. x (1880), p. 202; translated, Phil. Mag.x (1880), p. 357. E. Goldstein, Ann. d. Phys. xii (1881), p. 249. t Ann. d. Phys. xix (1883), p. 782.

from Faraday to J. J. Thomson. 397In the theory of Weber, electric phenomena were attributed
to the agency of stationary or moving charges, which could
most readily be pictured as having a discrete and atom-like
existence. The conception of displacement, on the other hand,
which lay at the root of the Maxwellian theory, was more in
harmony with the representation of electricity as somethingof a continuous nature; and as Maxwell's views met with
increasing acceptance, the atomistic hypothesis seemed to haveentered on a period of decay. Its revival was due largely to the
advocacy of Helmholtz,* who, in a lecture delivered to the
Chemical Society of London in 1881, pointed outf that it wasthoroughly in accord with the ideas of Faraday,J on whichMaxwell's theory was founded. "
If," he said, " we accept the
hypothesis that the elementary substances are composed of atoms, we cannot avoid concluding that electricity also, positive
as well as negative, is divided into definite elementary portions
which behave like atoms of electricity."
When the conduction of electricity is considered in the
light of this hypothesis, it seems almost inevitable to conclude
that the process is of much the same character in gases as in
electrolytes ; and before long this view was actively maintained.
It had indeed long been known that a compound gas might be
decomposed by the electric discharge ; and that in some cases the constituents are liberated at the electrodes in such a wayas to suggest an analogy with electrolysis. The question hadbeen studied in 1861 by Adolphe Perrot, who examined the
gases liberated by the passage of the electric spark through
steam. He found that while the product of this action wasa detonating mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, there was a
decided preponderance of hydrogen at one pole and of oxygen
at the other. The analogy of gaseous conduction to electrolysis wasapplied by W. Giese,|| of Berlin, in 1882, in order to explain

398 Conduction in Solutions and Gases, the conductivity of the hot gases of flames. " It is assumed,"he wrote,
" that in electrolytes, even before the applicationofan external electromotive force, there are present atomsoratomic groups the ions, as they are called which originatewhen the molecules dissociate ; hy these the passage of electri-city through the liquid is effected, for they are set in motionby the electric field and carry their charges with them. Weshall now extend this hypothesis by assuming that in gasesalso the property of conductivity is due to the presenceofions. Such ions may be supposed to exist in small numbersin all gases at the ordinary temperature and pressure ; andasthe temperature rises their numbers will increase." Ideas similar to this were presented in a general theoryofthe discharge in rarefied gases, which was devised two yearslater by Arthur Schuster, of Manchester.* Schuster remarkedthat when hot liquids are maintained at a high potential, thevapours which rise from them are found to be entirely freefrom electrification ; from which he inferred that a moleculestriking an electrified surface in its rapid motion cannot carryaway any part of the charge, and that one molecule cannotcommunicate electricity to another in an encounter in whichboth molecules remain intact. Thus he was led to the conclusion that dissociation of the gaseous molecules is necessaryfor the passage of electricity through gases. f
Schuster advocated the charged-particle theory of cathoderays, and by extending and interpreting an experimentofHittorfs was able to adduce strong evidence in its favour.He placed the positive and negative electrodes so close to eachother that at very low pressures the Crookes' dark spaceextended from the cathode to beyond the anode. In thesecircumstances it was found that the discharge from the positiveelectrode always passed to the nearest point of the innerboundary of the Crookes' dark space which, of course, wasin* Proc. Roy. Soc. xxxvii (1884), p. 317. t In the case of an elementary gas, this would imply dissociation of the moleculeinto two atoms chemically alike, but oppositely charged ; in electrolysis the.dissociation is into two chemically unlike ions.
Jrom Faraday to J. J. Thomson* 399the opposite direction to the ijathode. Thus, in the neighbourhood of the positive discharge, the current was flowing in twoopposite directions at closely adjoining places ; which could
scarcely happen unless the current in one direction werecarried by particles moving against the lines of force byvirtue of their inertia. Continuing his researches, Schuster* showed in 1887 that a steady electric current may be obtained in air betweenelectrodes whose difference of potential is but small, providedthat an independent current is maintained in the samevessel ; that is to say, a continuous discharge produces in the air such a condition that conduction occurs with the
smallest electromotive forces. This effect he explained byaid of the hypothesis previously advanced ; the ions producedby the main discharge become diffused throughout the vessel,
and, coming under the influence of the field set up by the
auxiliary electrodes, drift so as to carry a current betweenthe latter. A discovery related to this was made in the same year byHertz,f in the course of the celebrated researches? which havebeen already mentioned. Happening to notice that the passage
of one spark is facilitated by the passage of another spark in
its neighbourhood, he followed up the observation, and foundthe phenomenon to be due to the agency of ultra-violet light
emitted by the latter spark. It appeared in fact that thedistance across which an electric spark can pass in air is greatly increased when light of very short wave-length is allowed to fall on the spark-gap. It was soon found that the
effective light is that which falls on the negative electrode
of the gap ; and Wilhelm Hallwachs|| extended the discovery* Proc. Roy. Soc. xlii (1887), p. 371. Hittorf had discovered that very small
electromotive forces are sufficient to cause a discharge across a space through which
the cathode radiation is passing. t Berlin Ber., 1887, p. 487 ; Ann. d. Phys. xxxi (1887), p. 983 ; Electric Waves

by showing that when a sheet of metal is negatively electrifiedand exposed to ultra-violet light, the adjacent air is throwninto a state which permits the charge to leak rapidly away.Interest was now thoroughly aroused in the problemofconductivity in gases ; and it was generally felt that the besthope of divining the nature of the process lay in studyingthedischarge at high rarefactions. " If a first step towards understanding the relations between aether and ponderable matteristo be made," said Lord Kelvin in 1893,*
"
it seems to methatthe most hopeful foundation for it is knowledge derived fromexperiments on electricity in high vacuum."
Within the two following years considerable progress waseffected in this direction. J. J. Thomson,^ by a rotating-mirrormethod, succeeded in measuring the velocity of the cathode rays,finding it to be| 1*9 x 107 cm./sec. ; a value so much smaller thanthat of the velocity of light that it was scarcely possibletoconceive of the rays as vibrations of the aether. A furtherblow was dealt at the latter hypothesis when Jean Perrin,having received the rays in a metallic cylinder, found thatthe cylinder became charged with resinous electricity. Whenthe rays were deviated by a magnet in such a way that theycould no longer enter the cylinder, it no longer acquiredacharge. This appeared to demonstrate that the rays transportnegative electricity.
With cathode rays is closely connected another typeof radiation, which was discovered in December, 1895, byW. C. K6ntgen.ll The discovery seems to have originatedin an accident : a photographic plate which, protected in theusual way, had been kept in a room in which vacuum-tubeexperiments were carried on, was found on development to showdistinct markings. Experiments suggested by this showed* Proc. Roy. Soc. liv (1893), p. 389. t Phil. Mag. xxxviii (1894), p. 358.

that radiation, capable of affecting sensitive plates and of causing fluorescence in certain substances, is emitted by tubes
in which the electric discharge is passing; and that the radia- tion proceeds from the place where the cathode rays strike the glass walls of the tube. The X-rays, as they were called by their discoverer, are propagated in straight lines, and can
neither be refracted by any of the substances which refract
light, nor deviated from -their course by a magnetic field ; they are moreover able to pass with little absorption through
many substances which are opaque to ordinary and ultra-violet
light a property of which considerable use has been madein surgery. The nature of the new radiation was the subject of muchspeculation. Its discoverer suggested that it might prove to represent the long-sought-for longitudinal vibrations of the
aether ; while other writers advocated the rival claims of aethereal vortices, infra-red light, and "sifted" cathode rays. The hypothesis which subsequently obtained general acceptance was first propounded by Schuster* in the month following the
publication of Kontgen's researches. It is, that the X-rays are transverse vibrations of the aether, of exceedingly small wavelength. A suggestion which was put forward later in the year
by E. Wiechertf and Sir George StokesJ to the effect that the
rays are pulses generated in the aether when the glass of the
discharge tube is bombarded by the cathode particles, is not
really distinct from Schuster's hypothesis ; for ordinary white
light likewise consists of pulses, as Gouy had shown, and the
essential feature which distinguishes the Eontgen pulses is that
the harmonic vibrations into which they can be resolved byFourier's analysis are of very short period.

402 Conduction in Solutions and Gases,
The rapidity of the vibrations explains the failure of allattempts to refract the X-rays. For in the formula = !- "**
of the Maxwell-Sellmeier theory,* n denotes the frequency, andso is in this case extremely large ; whence we have
/*' = !,
i.e., the refractive index of all substances for the X-rays is unity.In fact, the vibrations alternate too rapidly to have an effecton the sluggish systems which are concerned in refraction.Some years afterwards H. Haga and C. H. Wind,f havingmeasured the diffraction-patterns produced by X-rays, concludedthat the wave-length of the vibrations concerned was of theo order of one Angstrom unit, that is about 1/6000 of the wavelength of the yellow light of sodium.
One of the most important properties of X-rays wasdiscovered, shortly after the rays themselves had become known,by J. J. Thomson,]: who announced that when they pass throughany substance, whether solid, liquid, or gaseous, they renderitconducting. This he attributed, in accordance with the ionictheory of conduction, to " a kind of electrolysis, the moleculeofthe non-conductor being split up, or nearly split up, bytheKb'ntgen rays."
The conductivity produced in gases by this means wasatonce investigated! more closely. It was found that a gas whichhad acquired conducting power by exposure to X-rays lost thisquality when forced through a plug of glass-wool; whenceit was inferred that the structure in virtue of which thegas conducts is of so coarse a character that it is unabletosurvive the passage through the fine pores of the plug. The* Cf. p. 293. t Proceedings of the Amsterdam Acad., March 25th, 1899 (English edition, i,p. 420), and September 27th, 1902 (English edition, v, p. 247).

from Faraday to J. J. Thomson. 403conductivity was also found to be destroyed when an electric current was passed through the gas a phenomenon for which
a parallel may be found in electrolysis. For if the ions were removed from an electrolytic solution by the passage of a
current, the solution would cease to conduct as soon as
sufficient electricity had passed to remove them all ; and it may be supposed that the conducting agents which are produced
in a gas by exposure to X-rays are likewise abstracted from it when they are employed to transport charges.
The same idea may be applied to explain another property
of gases exposed to X-rays. The strength of the current through the gas depends both on the intensity of the radiation
and also on the electromotive force ; but if the former factor be
constant, and the electromotive force be increased, the current does not increase indefinitely, but tends to attain a certain
" saturation
" value. The existence of this saturation value is evidently due to the inability of the electromotive force to do more than to remove the ions as fast as they are produced by
the rays. Meanwhile other evidence was accumulating to show that
the conductivity produced in gases by X-rays is of the same
nature as the conductivity of the gases from flames and from
the path of a discharge, to which the theory of Giese and
Schuster had already been applied. One proof of this identity was supplied by observations of the condensation of water- vapour into clouds. It had been noticed long before by
John Aitken* that gases rising from flames cause precipita- tion of the aqueous vapour from a saturated gas; and
E. von Helmholtzf had found that gases through which an
electric discharge has been passed possess the same property.
It was now shown by C. T. E. Wilson,% working in the
Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge, that the same is true of gases which have been exposed to X-rays. The explanation

furnished by the ionic theory is that in all three cases the gascontains ions which act as centres of condensation for thevapour.
During the year which followed their discovery, the X-rayswere so thoroughly examined that at the end of that periodthey were almost better understood than the cathode raysfrom which they derived their origin. But the obscurity inwhich this subject had been so long involved was now to bedispelled.
Lecturing at the Eoyal Institution on April 30th, 1897,J. J. Thomson advanced a new suggestion to reconcile themolecular- torrent hypothesis with Lenard's observations of thepassage of cathode rays through material bodies. " Weseefrom Lenard's table," he said,
" that a cathode ray can travelthrough air at atmospheric pressure a distance of about halfacentimetre before the brightness of the phosphorescence falls toabout half its original value. Now the mean free pathofthe molecule of air at this pressure is about 10~5 cm., and if amolecule of air were projected it would lose half its momentumin a space comparable with the mean free path. Even if wesuppose that it is not the same molecule that is carried, theeffect of the obliquity of the collisions would reduce themomentum to half in a short multiple of that path.
" Thus, from Lenard's experiments on the absorption of therays outside the tube, it follows on the hypothesis that thecathode rays are charged particles moving with high velocitiesthat the size of the carriers must be small compared with thedimensions of ordinary atoms or molecules.* The assumptionof a state of matter more finely subdivided than the atomofan element is a somewhat startling one ; but a hypothesis thatwould involve somewhat similar consequences viz. that theso-called elements are compounds of some primordial elementhas been put forward from time to time by variouschemists."
* A similar suggestion was made by E. Wiechert, Verhandl. d. physik.-ocon.Gesellscb. in Konigsberg, Jan. 1897.
from Faraday tcr J. J. Thomson. 405Thomson's lecture drew from Fitz Gerald* the suggestion
that " we are dealing with free electrons in these cathode rays
" a remark the point of which will become more evident whenwe come to consider the direction in which the Maxwelliantheory was being developed at this time. Shortly afterwards Thomson himself published an accountf of experiments in which the only outstanding objections to thecharged-particle theory were removed. The chief of these wasHertz' failure to deflect the cathode rays by an electrostatic
field. Hertz had caused the rays to travel between parallel
plates of metal maintained at different potentials ; but Thomsonnow showed that in these circumstances the rays generateions in the rarefied gas, which settle on the plates, and annulthe electric force in the intervening space. By carrying theexhaustion to a much higher degree, he removed this source of confusion, and obtained the expected deflexion of the rays. The electrostatic and magnetic deflexions taken togethersuffice to determine the ratio of the mass of a cathode particle
to the charge which it carries. For the equation of motion of the particle is rar = eE .+ e[v. H],
where r denotes the vector from the origin to the position of the particle ; E and H denote the electric and magnetic forces ; e the charge, m the mass, and v the velocity of the particle.
By observing the circumstances in which the force #E, due to the electric field, exactly balances the force e [v . H], due to themagnetic field, it is possible to determine v ; and it is readily seen from the above equation that a measurement of thedeflexion in the magnetic field supplies a relation between vand m/e ; so both v and m/e may be determined. Thomsonfound the value of m/e to be independent of the nature of therarefied gas : its amount was 10~7 (grammes/electromagnetic units
of charge), which is only about the thousandth part of the valueof m/e for the hydrogen atom in electrolysis. If the charge*

406 Conduction in Solutions and Gases, were supposed to be of the same order of magnitude as that onan electrolytic ion, it would be necessary to conclude that theparticle whose mass was thus measured is much smaller thanthe atom, and the conjecture might be entertained that it is theprimordial unit or corpuscle of which all atoms are ultimatelycomposed.*
The nature of the resinously charged corpuscles whichconstitute cathode rays being thus far determined, it becameofinterest to inquire whether corresponding bodies existed carryingcharges of vitreous electricity a question to which at any ratea provisional answer was given by W. Wienf of Aachen in thesame year. More than a decade previously E. Goldstein^ hadshown that when the cathode of a discharge-tube is perforated,radiation of a certain type passes outward through the perforations into the part of the tube behind the cathode. Tothis radiation he had given the name canal rays. Wiennowshowed that the canal rays are formed of positively chargedparticles, obtaining a value of m/e immensely larger thanThomson had obtained for the cathode rays, and indeedofthe same order of magnitude as the corresponding ratio inelectrolysis.
The disparity thus revealed between the corpuscles ofcathode rays and the positive ions of Goldstein's rays excitedgreat interest ; it seemed to offer a prospect of explaining thecurious differences between the relations of vitreous andofresinous electricity to ponderable matter. These phenomenahad been studied by many previous investigators ; in particularSchuster, in the Bakerian lecture of 1890, had remarked that"
if the law of impact is different between the molecules of thegas and the positive and negative ions respectively, it followsthat the rate of diffusion of the two sets of ions will in generalbe different," and had inferred from his theory of the discharge* The value of m/e for cathode rays was determined also in the same year byW.

Jrom Faraday to J. J. Thomson. 407that " the negative ions diffuse more rapidly." This inferencewas confirmed in 1898 by John Zeleny,* who showed that of the ions produced in air by exposure to X-rays, the positive are decidedly less mobile than the negative.
The magnitude of the electric charge on the ions of gaseswas not known with certainty until 1898, when a plan for determining it was successfully executed by J. J. Thomson.fThe principles on which this celebrated investigation was basedare very ingenious. By measuring the current in a gas whichis exposed to Rontgen rays and subjected to a known electro- motive force, it is possible to determine the value of the productnev, where n denotes the number of ions in unit volume of thegas, e the charge on an ion, and v the mean velocity of thepositive and negative ions under the electromotive force. Asv had been already determined ,J the experiment led to adetermination of ne ; so if n could be found, the value of e might be deduced.
The method employed by Thomson to determine n wasfounded on the discovery, to which we have already referred,
that when X-rays pass through dust-free air, saturated withaqueous vapour, the ions act as nuclei around which the watercondenses, so that a cloud is produced by such a degree of saturation as would ordinarily be incapable of producing condensation. The size of the drops was calculated from measure-ments of the rate at which the cloud sank ; and, by comparingthis estimate with the measurement of the mass of waterdeposited, the number of drops was determined, and hence thenumber n of ions. The value of e consequently deduced wasfound to be independent of the nature of the gas in which theions were produced, being approximately the same in hydrogenas in air, and being apparently in both cases the same as for the charge carried by the hydrogen ion in electrolysis.

ions have been abundantly confirmed. It appears certain thatelectric charge exists in discrete units, vitreous and resinous,each of magnitude 1*5 x 10~19 coulombs approximately. Eachion, whether in an electrolytic liquid or in a gas, carries one(or an integral number) of these charges. An electrolytic ionalso contains one or more atoms of matter; and a positivegaseous ion has a mass of the same order of magnitude as thatof an atom of matter. But it is possible in many waystoproduce in a gas negative ions which are not attached to atomsof matter ; for these the inertia is only about one-thousandthof the inertia of an atom; and there is reason for believingthat even this apparent mass is in its origin purely electrical.*The closing years of the nineteenth century saw the foundation of another branch of experimental science which is closelyrelated to the study of conduction in gases. When Rontgenannounced his discovery of the X-rays, and described theirpower of exciting phosphorescence, a number of other workerscommenced to investigate this property more completely. Inparticular, Henri Becquerel resolved to examine the radiationswhich are emitted by the phosphorescent double sulphate ofuranium and potassium after exposure to the sun. The resultwas communicated to the French Academy on February 24th,1896.f
" Let a photographic plate," he said,
" be wrappedintwo sheets of very thick black paper, such that the plate is notaffected by exposure to the sun for a day. Outside the paperplace a quantity of the phosphorescent substance, and exposethe whole to the sun for several hours. When the plate isdeveloped, it displays a silhouette of the phosphorescentsubstance. So the latter must emit radiations which arecapable of passing through paper opaque to ordinary light, andof reducing salts of silver." At this time Becquerel supposed the radiation to have beenexcited by the exposure of the phosphorescent substance to thesun ; but a week later he announced^ that it persisted for an* Cf. p. 343. f Comptes Rendus, cxxii (1890), p. 420.

from Faraday to J'. J. Thomson. 409indefinite time after the substance had been removed from the
sunlight, and after the luminosity which properly constitutes
phosphorescence had died away ; and he was thus led to con- clude that the activity was spontaneous and permanent. It was soon found that those salts of uranium which do not
phosphoresce e.g., the uranous salts, and the metal itself, all emit the rays ; and it became evident that what Becquerel haddiscovered was a radically new physical property, possessed bythe element uranium in all its chemical compounds.
Attempts were now made to trace this activity in other
substances. In 1898 it was recognized in thorium and its compounds;* and in the same year P. Curie and MadameSklodowska Curie announced to the French Academy the
separation from the mineral pitchblende of two new highly
active elements, to which they gave the names of poloniumf andradium.}: A host of workers was soon engaged in studying the
properties of the Becquerel rays. The discoverer himself hadshown in 1896 that these rays, like the X- and cathode rays, impart conductivity to gases. It was found in 1899 by
Kutherfordll that the rays from uranium are not all of the samekind, biit that at least two distinct types are present ; one of these, to which he gave the name a-rays, is readily absorbed ; while another, which he named /3-radiation, has a greater

THE THEORY OF AETHER AND ELECTRONS IN THE CLOSING
YEARS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.
THE attempts of Maxwell* and of Hertzf to extend the theory
of the electromagnetic field to the case in which ponderable
bodies are in motion had not been altogether successful. Neither writer had taken account of any motion of the material
particles relative to the aether entangled with them, so that in both investigations the moving bodies were regarded simply
as homogeneous portions of the medium which fills all space, distinguished only by special values of the electric andmagnetic constants. Such an assumption is evidently inconsistent with the admirable theory by which FresnelJ hadexplained the optical behaviour of moving transparent bodies ; it was therefore not surprising that writers subsequent to Hertz
should have proposed to replace his equations by others
designed to agree with Fresnel's formulae. Before discussing
these, however, it may be well to review briefly the evidence
for and against the motion of the aether in and adjacent
to moving ponderable bodies, as it appeared in the last decade
of the nineteenth century.
The phenomena of aberration had been explained by Young
on the assumption that the aether around bodies is unaffected
by their motion. But it was shown by Stokes|| in 1845 that
this is not the only possible explanation. For suppose that
the motion of the earth communicates motion to the neighbouring portions of the aether ; this may be regarded as superposed on the vibratory motion which the aethereal particles have

when transmitting light : the orientation of the wave-frontsofthe light will consequently in general be altered ; and the direc-tion in which a heavenly body is seen, being normal to the wavefronts will thereby be affected. But if the aethereal motionis irrotational, so that the elements of the aether do notrotate, it is easily seen that the direction of propagation of thelight in space is unaffected ; the luminous disturbance is stillpropagated in straight lines from the star, while the normalto the wave-front at any point deviates from this lineofpropagation by the small angle ujc, where u denotes thecomponent of the aethereal velocity at the point, resolvedatright angles to the line of propagation, and c denotes thevelocity of light. If it be supposed that the aether neartheearth is at rest relatively to the earth's surface, the star willappear to be displaced towards the direction in whichtheearth is moving, through an angle measured by the ratioofthe velocity of the earth to the velocity of light, multipliedbythe sine of the angle between the direction of the earth'smotion and the line joining the earth and star. Thisisprecisely the law of aberration.
An objection to Stokes's theory has been pointed outbyseveral writers, amongst others by H. A. Lorentz.* Thisis,that the irrotational motion of an incompressible fluid iscompletely determinate when the normal component of thevelocity at its boundary is given : so that if the aether weresupposed to have the same normal component of velocityasthe earth, it would not have the same tangential componentofvelocity. It follows that no motion will in general exist whichsatisfies Stokes's conditions ; and the difficulty is not solvedinany very satisfactory fashion by either of the suggestions which,have been proposed to meet it. One of these is to suppose thatthe moving earth does generate a rotational disturbance, which,however, being radiated away with the velocity of light, does notaffect the steadier irrotational motion ; the other, which was* Archives Neerl, xxi (1896), p. 103.
Closing Years of the Nineteenth Century. 413-advanced by Planck,* is that the two conditions of Stokes's
theory namely, that the motion of the aether is to be
irrotational and that at the earth's surface its velocity is to be
the same as that of the earth may both be satisfied if the
aether is supposed to be compressible in accordance with
Boyle's law, and subject to gravity, so that round the earth it
is compressed like the atmosphere ; the velocity of light being
supposed independent of the condensation of the aether. Lorentz,f in calling attention to the defects of Stokes's
theory, proposed to combine the ideas of Stokes and Fresnel, by
assuming that the aether near the earth is moving irrotationally
(as in Stokes's theory), but that at the surface of the earth the
aethereal velocity is not necessarily the same as that of ponderable matter, and that (as in Fresiiel's theory) a material body
imparts the fraction (ju
2 -
l}/ju
2 of its own motion to the aether
within it. Fresnel's theory is a particular case of this newtheory, being derived from it by supposing the velocity -potential
to be zero. Aberration is by no means the only astronomical phenomenon
which depends on the velocity of propagation of light ; we have
indeed seent that this velocity was originally determined by
observing the retardation of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites. It was remarked by Maxwell in 1879 that these eclipses
furnish, theoretically at least, a means of determining the
velocity of the solar system relative to the aether. For if the
distance from the eclipsed satellite to the earth be divided by
the observed retardation in time of the eclipse, the quotient
represents the velocity of propagation of light in this direction, relative to the solar system; and this will differ from the velocity
of propagation of light relative to the aether by the component,
in this direction, of the sun's velocity relative to the aether. By taking observations when Jupiter is in different signs of the

zodiac, it should therefore be possible to determine the sun'svelocity relative to the aether, or at least that component ofitwhich lies in the ecliptic.
The same principles may be applied to the discussion ofother astronomical phenomena. Thus the minimum ofavariable star of the Algol type will be retarded or acceleratedby an interval of time which is found by dividing the projectionof the radius from the sun to the earth on the direction fromthe sun to the Algol variable by the velocity, relative to thesolar system, of propagation of light from the variable ; and thusthe latter quantity may be deduced from observations of theretardation.*
Another instance in which the time taken by light to crossan orbit influences an observable quantity is afforded by theastronomy of double stars. Savaryf long ago remarked thatwhen the plane of the orbit of a double star is not at rightangles to the line of sight, an inequality in the apparent motionmust be caused by the circumstance that the light from theremoter star has the longer journey to make. Yvon VillarceauJshowed that the effect might be represented by a constantalteration of the elliptic elements of the orbit (which alterationis of course beyond detection), together with a periodicinequality, which may be completely specified by the followingstatement : the apparent coordinates of one star relative to theother have the values which in the absence of this effect theywould have at an earlier or later instant, differing from theactual time by the amount

the line of sight. In the existing state of double-star astronomy,
this effect would be masked by errors of observation.
Villarceau also examined the consequences of supposing
that the velocity of light depends on the velocity of the source by which it is emitted. If, for instance, the velocity of light
from a star occulted by the moon were less than the velocity of light reflected by the moon, then the apparent position of the
lunar disk would be more advanced in its movement than that
of the star, so that at emersion the star would first appear at some distance outside the lunar disk, and at immersion the star would be projected on the interior of the disk at the instant of
its disappearance. The amount by which the image of the star could encroach on that of the disk on this account could not be
so much as 0"'71 ; encroachment to the extent of more than
1" has been observed, but is evidently to be attributed for the
most part to other causes. Among the consequences of the finite velocity of propagation
of light which are of importance in astronomy, a leading place
must be assigned to the principle enunciated in 1842 by Christian
Doppler,* that the motion of a source of light relative to an
observer modifies the period of the disturbance which is received by him. The phenomenon resembles the depression
of the pitch of a note when the source of sound is receding from
the observer. In either case, the period of the vibrations
perceived by the observer is (c + v) /
c x the natural period,
where v denotes the velocity of separation of the source and
observer, and c denotes the velocity of propagation of the
disturbance. If, e.g., the velocity of separation is equal to the orbital velocity of the earth, the D lines of sodium in the
spectrum of the source will be displaced towards the red, as compared with lines derived from a terrestrial sodium flame, bs
about one-tenth of the distance between them. The application
of this principle to the determination of the relative velocity of

416 The Theory of Aether and Electrons in the
stars in the line of sight, which has proved of great serviceinastrophysical research, was suggested by Fizeau in 1848.*
Passing now from the astronomical observatory, we mustexamine the information which has been gained in the physicallaboratory regarding the effect of the earth's motion on opticalphenomena. We have alreadyf referred to the investigationsby which the truth of Fresnel's formula was tested. Anexperiment of a different type was suggested in 1852byFizeauJ who remarked that, unless the aether is carried alongby the earth, the radiation emitted by a terrestrial source shouldhave different intensities in different directions. It was, however, shown long afterwards by Lorentz that such an experimentwould not be expected on theoretical grounds to yield a positiveresult ; the amount of radiant energy imparted to an absorbingbody is independent of the earth's motion. A few years laterFizeau investigatedll another possible effect. If a beamofpolarized light is sent obliquely through a glass plate, theazimuth of polarization is altered to an extent which depends,amongst other things, on the refractive index of the glass.Fizeau performed this experiment with sunlight, the lightbeing sent through the glass in the direction of the terrestrialmotion, and in the opposite direction ; the readings seemedtodiffer in the two cases, but on account of experimental difficultiesthe result was indecisive. Some years later, the effect of the earth's motion ontherotation of the plane of polarization of light propagated alongthe axis of a quartz crystal was investigated by Mascart.^f Theresult was negative, Mascart stating that the rotation couldnot have been altered by more than the (l/40,000)th part whenthe orientation of the apparatus was reversed from thatof* An apparatus for demonstrating the Doppler-Fizeau effect in the laboratorywas constructed by Belopolsky, Astrophys.

afterwards confirmed by Lord Kayleigh,* who found that the
alteration, if it existed, could not amount to (l/100,000)th
part.
In terrestrial methods of determining the velocity of light
the ray is made to retrace its path, so that any velocity which
the earth might possess with respect to the luminiferous mediumwould affect the time of the double passage only by an amount
proportional to the square of the constant of aberration.f In
1881, however, A. A. MichelsonJ remarked that the effect, though of the second order, should be manifested by a measurable difference between the times for rays describing equal
paths parallel and perpendicular respectively to the direction of the earth's motion. He produced interference-fringes between
two pencils of light which had traversed paths perpendicular
to each other ; but when the apparatus was rotated through a
right angle, so that the difference would be reversed, the expected
displacement of the fringes could not be perceived. This result was regarded by Michelson himself as a vindication of Stokes's theory^ in which the aether in the neighbourhood of the
dearth is supposed to be set in motion. Lorentzj), however,
showed that the quantity to be measured had only half the
value supposed by Michelson, and suggested that the negative
result of the experiment might be explained by that combination of Fresnel's and Stokes's theories which was developed in
his own memoirIF ; since, if the velocity of the aether near the
earth were (say) half the earth's velocity, the displacement of Michelson's fringes would be insensible.

418 The Theory of Aether and Electrons in the
A sequel to the experiment of Michelson and Morleywasperformed in 1897, when Michelson* attempted to determineby experiment whether the relative motion of earth and aethervaries with the vertical height above the terrestrial surface.No result, however, could be obtained to indicate that thevelocity of light depends on the distance from the centreofthe earth ; and Michelson concluded that if there were no choice<"but between the theories of Fresnel and Stokes, it wouldbenecessary to adopt the latter, and to suppose that the earth'sinfluence on the aether exends to many thousand kilometresabove its surface. By this time, however, as will subsequentlyappear, a different explanation was at hand.
Meanwhile the perplexity of the subject was increasedbyexperimental results which pointed in the opposite directionto that of Michelson. In 1892 Sir Oliver Lodgef observedtheinterference between the two portions of a bifurcated beamoflight, which were made to travel in opposite directions rounda closed path in the space
* between two rapidly rotating steeldisks. The observations showed that the velocity of lightisnot affected by the motion of adjacent matter to the extentof(l/200)th part of the velocity of the matter. Continuinghisinvestigations, Lodge} strongly magnetized the moving matter(iron in this experiment), so that the light was propagatedacross a moving magnetic field ; and electrified it so that thepath of the beams lay in a moving electrostatic field ; butinno case was the velocity of the light appreciably affected. We must now trace the steps by which theoretical physicistsnot only arrived at a solution of the apparent contradictionsfurnished by experiments with moving bodies, but so extendedthe domain of electrical science that it became necessarytoenlarge the boundaries of space and time to contain it.

Clausius,* a theory of electrons ; that is to say, all electro- dynamical phenomena were ascribed to the agency of moving
electric charges, which were supposed in a magnetic field to experience forces proportional to their velocities, and to communicate these forces to the ponderable matter with which
they might be associated.t
In spite of the fact that the earlier theories of electrons had failed to fulfil the expectations of their authors, the
assumption that all electric and magnetic phenomena are due
to the presence or motion of individual electric charges wasone to which physicists were at this time disposed to give a favourable consideration ; for, as we have seen,* evidence of the atomic nature of electricity was now contributed by the
study of the conduction of electricity through liquids and gases. Moreover, the discoveries of Hertz had shown that a molecule
which is emitting light must contain some system resembling
a Hertzian vibrator; and the essential process in a Hertzian
vibrator is the oscillation of electricity to and fro. Lorentz
himself from the outset of his career! | had supposed the inter- action of ponderable matter with the electric field to be effected by the agency of electric charges associated with the material atoms. The principal difference by which the theory now advanced
by Lorentz is distinguished from the theories of Weber,

universe, has hitherto exercised hut little influence on general electromagnetic
theory. The reason for this is that in theoretical investigations it is customary

420 The Theory of Aether and Electrons in the
Kiemann, and Clausing, and from Lorentz' own earlier work,lies in the conception which is entertained of the propagationof influence from one electron to another. In the older writings, the electrons were assumed to be capable of acting oneach other at a distance, with forces depending on theircharges, mutual distances, and velocities ; in the presentmemoir, on the other hand, the electrons were supposedtointeract not directly with each other, but with the mediuminwhich they were embedded. To this medium were ascribed theproperties characteristic of the aether in Maxwell's theory.
The only respect in which Lorentz' medium differed fromMaxwell's was in regard to the effects of the motion of bodies.Impressed by the success of Fresnel's beautiful theory ofthe propagation of light in moving transparent substances,*Lorentz designed his equations so as to accord with thattheory, and showed that this might be done by drawingadistinction between matter and aether, and assuming thatamoving ponderable body cannot communicate its motion tothe aether which surrounds it, or even to the aether whichis entangled in its own particles ; so that no part of the aethercan be in motion relative to any other part. Such an aethersimply space endowed with certain dynamical properties.
The general plan of Lorentz' investigation was to reduce allthe complicated cases of electromagnetic action to one simpleand fundamental case, in which the field contains only freeaether with solitary electrons dispersed in it ; the theory whichhe adopted in this fundamental case was a combination ofClausius' theory of electricity with Maxwell's theory of theaether. Suppose that e (x, y, z) and e(x, y', z) are two electrons.In the theory of Clausius,f the kinetic potential of their mutualaction is
ee' (xx + yy + ss' - c

p denoting the volume-density of electric charge, and v its velocity, and the integration being taken over all space. We shall now reject Clausius' assumption that electrons act instantaneously at a distance, and replace it by the assumptionthat they act on each other only through the mediation of anaether which fills all space, and satisfies Maxwell's equations.This modification may be effected in Clausius' theory withoutdifficulty ; for, as we have seen,* if the state of Maxwell'saether at any point is defined by the electric vector d andmagnetic vector h,f these vectors may be expressed in termsof potentials a and ^ by the equations
d = c" grad < - a, h = curl a ; and the functions a and < may in turn be expressed in terms of the electric charges by the equations

account has been taken only of the ultimate constituents of which the universe is supposed to be composed, namely, cor- puscles and the aether. We must now see how to build up
from these the more complex systems which are directly
presented to our experience.
The electromagnetic field in ponderable bodies, which to our
senses appears in general to vary continuously, would present a
different aspect if we were able to discern molecular structure ; we should then perceive the individual electrons by which the
field is produced, and the rapid fluctuations of electric and
magnetic force between them. As it is, the values furnished
by our instruments represent averages taken over volumes
which, though they appear small to us, are large compared
with molecular dimensions.* We shall denote an average
value of this kind by a bar placed over the corresponding symbol.
Lorentz supposed that the phenomena of electrostatic charge
and of conduction-currents are due to the presence or motion of simple electrons such as have been considered above. The part
of p arising from these is the measurable density of electrostatic charge ; this we shall denote by pi. If w denote the velocity
of the ponderable matter, and if the velocity v of the electrons be written w + u, then the quantity pv, so far as it arises from
electrons of this type, may be written ^ w + pu. The former of these terms represents the convection-current, and the latter the conduction-current.
Consider next the phenomena of dielectrics. Following
Faraday, Thomson, and Mossotti,f Lorentz supposed that each
dielectric molecule contains corpuscles charged vitreously andalso corpuscles charged resinously. These in the absence of an* These principles had been enunciated, and to some extent developed, by

external field are so arranged as to neutralize each other's electricfields outside the molecule. For simplicity we may supposethat in each molecule only one corpuscle, of charge e, is capableof being displaced from its position ; it follows from whathasbeen assumed that the other corpuscles in the molecule exertthe same electrostatic action as a charge - e situated at theoriginal position of this corpuscle. Thus if e is displaced to anadjacent position, the entire molecule becomes equivalent to anelectric doublet, whose moment is measured by the- product ofeand the displacement of e. The molecules in unit volume, takentogether, will in this way give rise to a (vector) electric momentper unit volume, P, which may be compared to the (vector)intensity of magnetization in Poisson's theory of magnetism.*As in that theory, we may replace the doublet -distributionPof the scalar quantity p by a volume-distribution of p, determinedby the equationf
p = - div P. This represents the part of jo due to the dielectric molecules.Moreover, the scalar quantity pwx has also a doublet-distri-bution, to which the same theorem may be applied ; the averagevalue of the part of pwx, due to dielectric molecules, is thereforedetermined by the equation
pwx
= - div (W.J.?) = - wx div P -
(P . V) wx , or /ow = - div P . w -
(P . V) w. We have now to find that part of ju which is due to dielectricmolecules. For a single doublet of moment p we have, bydifferentiation,
fJJ pM dx dy dz =

where the integration is taken throughout the molecule;sothat

written
Now, if P refers to differentiation at a fixed point of space (as
opposed to a differentiation which accompanies the moving body), we have

and (d/dt) V = Fdiv w;
so that
/ou = P + (w . V) P + div w . P
= P + curl [P . w] + div P . w + (P . V) w, and therefore pu + pw = P + curl [P . w].
This equation determines the part of f>v which arises from the
dielectric molecules.

The term D in S evidently represents the displacement-current of Maxwell ; and the term curl [P . w] will berecognized as a modified form of the term curl [D . w], whichwas first introduced into the equations by Hertz.* It willbe remembered that Hertz supposed this term to repre-sent the generation of a magnetic force within a dielectricwhich is in motion in an electric field ; and that Heaviside,fbyadducing considerations relative to the energy, showed that theterm ought to be regarded as part of the total current, andinferred from its existence that a dielectric which moves in anelectric field is the seat of an electric current, which producesa magnetic field in the surrounding space. The modificationintroduced by Lorentz consisted in replacing D by P in thevector-product ; this implied that the moving dielectric doesnot carry along the aethereal displacement, which is representedby the term E/4?rc

(1892) by Helmholtz, Berl. Ber., 1892, p. 1093, Ann d. Phys. xlviii (1893), pp. 389, 723. In this, as in Lorentz' theory, the incident light is supposed to excite sympathetic vibrations in the electric doublets which exist in the molecules
of transparent bodies. Helmholtz' equations were, however, derived in a different way from those of Lorentz, being deduced from the Principle of Least Action. The final result is, as in Lorentz' theory, represented (when the effect of damping
is neglected) by the Maxwell-Sellmeier formula. Helmholtz' theory was developed
further by Reiff, Ann. d. Phys. Iv (1895), p. 82. In a theory .of dispersion given by Planck, Berl. Ber., 1902, p. 470, the damping of the oscillations is assumed to be due to the loss of energy by radiation : so that no new constant is required in order to express it. Lorentz, in his lectures on the Iheory of Electrons (Leipzig, 1909), p. 141, suggested that the dissipative term in the equations of motion of dielectric electrons might be ascribed to the destruction of the regular vibrations of tit^electrons within a molecule by the collisions of the molecule with other molecule Some interesting references to the ideas of Hertz on the elet.:t)magnetic explanation of dispersion will be found in a memoir by Drude, Ann. d.

P M" which is the formula of Fresnel.* The hypothesis of Fresnel,
that a ponderable body in motion carries with it the excess of aether which it contains as compared with space free from
matter, is thus seen to be transformed in Lorentz' theory
into the supposition that the polarized molecules of the
dielectric, like so many small condensers, increase the dielectric constant, and that it is (so to speak) this augmentation of the
dielectric constant which travels with the moving matter. One
evident objection to Fresnel's theory, namely, that it required
the relative velocity of aether and matter to be different for
light of different colours, is thus removed ; for the theory of Lorentz only requires that the dielectric constant should have
different values for light of different colours, and of this a satisfactory explanation is provided by the theory of dispersion.
The correctness of Lorentz' hypothesis, as opposed to that of { Hertz (in which the whole of the contained aether was supposed to be transported with the moving body), was afterwards confirmed
by various experiments. In 1901 E. Blondlotf drove a current
of air through a magnetic field, at right angles to the lines of magnetic force. The air-current was made to pass between the
faces of a condenser, which were connected by a wire, so as to be
at the same potential. An electromotive force E' would be
produced in the air by its motion in the magnetic field ; and,
according to the theory of Hertz, this should produce an
electric induction D of amount (e/47rc
2 ) E' (where t denotes the
specific inductive capacity of the air, which is practically
unity) ; so that, according to Hertz, the faces of the condenser
should become charged. According to Lorentz' theory, on the
other hand, the electric induction D is determined by the
equation
47rc2 D = E + (e - 1) E'

where E denotes the electric force on a charge at rest, whichiszero in the present case. Thus, according to Lorentz' theory,the charges on the faces would have only (e -
l)/e of the valueswhich they would have in Hertz' theory ; that is, they wouldbepractically zero. The result of Blondlot's experiment wasinfavour of the theory of Lorentz. An experiment of a similar character was performedin1905 by H. A. Wilson.* In this, the space between the innerand outer coatings of a cylindrical condenser was filled withthe dielectric ebonite. When the coatings of such a con-denser are maintained at a definite difference of potential,charges are induced on them ; and if the condenser be rotatedon its axis in a magnetic field whose lines of force are parallelto the axis, these charges will be altered, owing to theadditional polarization which is produced in the dielectricmolecules by their motion in the magnetic field. As before,the value of the additional charge according to the theoryofLorentz is (e -
l)/e times its value as calculated by the theoryof Hertz. The result of Wilson's experiments was, like thatofBlondlot's, in favour of Lorentz. The reconciliation of the electromagnetic theory withFresnel's law of the propagation of light in moving bodies wasa distinct advance. But the theory of the motionless aetherwas hampered by one difficulty : it was, in its original form,incompetent to explain the negative result of the experimentof Michelson and Morley.f The adjustment of theorytoobservation in this particular was achieved by means of aremarkable hypothesis which must now be introduced.
In the issue of " Nature" for June 16th, 1892,J Lodgementioned that Fitz Gerald had communicated to him a newsuggestion for overcoming the difficulty. This was, to supposethat the dimensions of material bodies are slightly alteredwhen they are in motion relative to the aether. Five monthsafterwards, this hypothesis of Fitz Gerald's was adoptedby*Phii. Trans, cciv (1905), p. 121. t Cf. p 417. J Nature, xlvi (1892), p. 165,

after which it won favour in a gradually widening circle, until eventually it came to be generally taken as the basis of all theoretical investigations on the motion of ponderable bodies
through the aether. Let us first see how it explains Michelson's result. On the supposition that the aether is motionless, one of the
two portions into which the original beam of light is divided
should accomplish its journey in a time less than the other by
ur*l/c?, where w denotes the velocity of the earth, c the velocity
of light, and I the length of each arm. This would be exactly
compensated if the arm which is pointed in the direction of the
terrestrial motion were shorter than the other by an amount
w2//2c
3
; as would be the case if the linear dimensions of moving bodies were always contracted in the direction of their motion in the ratio of (1 - w' /2c~) to unity. This is Fitz Gerald's hypothesis of contraction. Since for the earth the
ratio w/c is only
30 km./sec. 300,000 km./sec.'
the fraction w^jc- is only one hundred-millionth.
Several further contributions to the theory of electrons in a motionless aether were made in a short treatisef which was
published by Lorentz in 1895. One of these related to the
explanation of an experimental result obtained some years
previously by Th. des Coudres,J of Leipzig. Des Coudres had
observed the mutual inductance of coils in different circumstances of inclination of their common axis to the direction of the earth's motion, but had been unable to detect any effect depending on the orientation. Lorentz now showed that this could be explained by considerations similar to those which

Budde and Fitz Gerald* had advanced in a similar case ; aconductor carrying a constant electric current and moving withthe earth would exert a force on electric charges at relativerest in its vicinity, were it not that this force induces onthesurface of the conductor itself a compensating electrostaticcharge, whose action annuls the expected effect. The most satisfactory method of discussing the influenceofthe terrestrial motion on electrical phenomena is to transformthe fundamental equations of the aether and electrons to axesmoving with the earth. Taking the axis of x parallel to thedirection of the earth's motion, and denoting the velocity of theearth by w, we write x = #1 + wtt y
=
2/1, z = Zi, so that (x-i, yit Zj) denote coordinates referred to axes movingwith the earth. Lorentz completed the change of coordinatesby introducing in place of the variable t a "local time"tl}defined by the equation
t = tl + m^/c2
. It is also necessary to introduce, in place of d and h, the electricand magnetic forces relative to the moving axes : these aretd1 = d + [w.h]
h1 = h + (l/c
2) [d.w];
and in place of the velocity v of an electron referred to^theoriginal fixed axes, we must introduce its velocity Vi relativetothe moving axes, which is given by the equation
V, = V - W. The fundamental equations of the aether and electrons,referred to the original axes, are

Since these have the same form as the original equations,
it follows that when terms depending on the square of the constant of aberration are neglected, all electrical phenomenamay be expressed with reference to axes moving with the earth
by the same equations as if the axes were at rest relative to the
aether. In the last chapter of the Versuch Lorentz discussed those
experimental results which were as yet unexplained by the
theory of the motionless aether. That the terrestrial motion
exerts no influence on the rotation of the plane of polarization in quartz* might be explained by supposing that twoindependent effects, which are both due to the earth's motion,
cancel each other; but Lorentz left the question undecided.
Five years later Larmorf criticized this investigation, andarrived at the conclusion that there should be no first-order
effect ; but LorentzJ afterwards maintained his position against
Larmor's criticism. Although the physical conceptions of Lorentz had from
the beginning included that of atomic electric charges, the
analytical equations had hitherto involved p, the volume-density
of electric charge; that is, they had been conformed to the
hypothesis of a continuous distribution of electricity in space.

analytical theory of electrons, nothing more would be requiredthan to modify the formulae by writing e (the charge of anelectron) in place of pdxdydz. That this is not the case wasshown* a few years after the publication of the Versuch. Consider, for example, the formula for the scalar potentialat any point in the aether,
where the bar indicates that the quantity underneath it is tohave its retarded value,f
This integral, in which the integration is extended overallelements of space, must be transformed before the integrationcan be taken to extend over moving elements of charge. Letde denote the sum of the electric charges which are accountedfor under the heading of the volume- element dx'dy'dz inthe above integral. This quantity de is not identical with~p'dx'dy'dz'. For, to take the simplest case, suppose that it isrequired to compute the value of the potential-function for theorigin at the time t, and that the charge is receding fromtheorigin along the axis of x with velocity u. The charge whichis to be ascribed to any position x is the charge which occupiesthat position at the instant t -

investigations. The most interesting of these was due to Fitz Gerald,* who shortly before his death in February, 1901,
commenced to examine the phenomena manifested by a charged electrical condenser, as it is carried through space in
consequence of the terrestrial motion. On the assumption
that a moving charge develops a magnetic field, there will be
associated with the condenser a magnetic force at right angles
to the lines of electric force and to the direction of the
motion: magnetic energy must therefore be stored in the
medium, when the plane of the condenser includes the direc- tion of the drift; but when the plane of the condenser is at right angles to the terrestrial motion, the effects of the
opposite charges neutralize each other. Fitz Gerald's original
idea was that, in order to supply the magnetic energy, there
must be a mechanical drag on the condenser at the moment of

charging, similar to that which would be produced if the massof a body at the surface of the earth were suddenly to becomegreater. Moreover, it was conjectured that the condenser,when freely suspended, would tend to move so as to assumethelongitudinal orientation, which is that of maximum kineticenergy* : the transverse position would therefore be oneofunstable equilibrium.
For both effects a search was made by Fitz Gerald's pupilTrouton :f in the experiments designed to observe the turningcouple, a condenser was suspended in a vertical plane byafine wire, and charged. If the plane of the condenser werethat of the meridian, about noon there should be no coupletending to alter the orientation, because the drift of aether dueto the earth's motion would be at right angles to this plane;at any other hour, a couple should act. The effect tobedetected was extremely small ; for the magnetic force duetothe motion of the charges would be of order w/c, wherewdenotes the velocity of the earth ; so the magnetic energyofthe system, which depends on the square of the force, wouldbeof order (w/c)' ; and the couple, which depends on the derivateof this with respect to the azimuth, would therefore be likewiseof the second order in (w/c).
No couple could be detected. As the energy of the magneticfield must be derived from some source, there seems to benoescape from the conclusion that the electrostatic energy ofacharged condenser is diminished by the fraction (w/c)" of itsamount when the condenser is moving with velocity watright angles to its lines of electrostatic force. To explain thisdiminution, it is necessary to admit Fitz Gerald's hypothesisof contraction.

respect to the direction of the terrestrial motion.
It may be remarked that the existence of the couple, hadit been observed, would have demonstrated the possibility of drawing on the energy of the earth's motion for purposes of terrestrial utility.
The Fitz Gerald contraction of matter as it moves through
the aether might conceivably be supposed to affect in someway the optical properties of the moving matter; for in- stance, transparent substances might become doubly refracting.
Experiments designed to test this supposition were per- formed by Lord Eayieigh in 1902,* and by D. B. Brace in 1904t ; but no double refraction comparable with the proportion (w/cf of the single refraction could be detected. TheFitz Gerald contraction of a material body cannot therefore be
of the same nature as the contraction which would be produced
in the body by pressure, but must be accompanied by such
concomitant changes in the relations of the molecules to the
aether that an isotropic substance does not lose its simply
refracting character. By this time, indeed, the hypothesis of contraction, whichoriginally had no direct connexion with electric theory, hadassumed a new aspect. Lorentz, as we have seen,J hadobtained the equations of a moving electric system byapplying a transformation to the fundamental equations of the aether. In the original form of this transformation,
quantities of higher order than the first in w/c were neglected.
But in 1900 Larmorg extended the analysis so as to include
small quantities of the second order, and thereby discovered a remarkable connexion between the equations of transformation and the equations which represent Fitz Gerald's conPhil. Mag. iv (1902), p. 678. t Phil. Mag. vii (1904), p. 317.

their form unaltered, when the variables are subjected to the
transformation which has been specified.
We are now in a position to show the connexion of this transformation with Fitz Gerald's hypothesis of contraction.
Suppose that two material particles are moving along the axis
of x with velocity w - c tanh a. From the relation vx . sech a
vx = c tanh a + = - cosh a + vXi c~

it follows that vXl is zero for each of the particles, which implies
that they are at rest relative to the new axes. Let %i and x\
denote their coordinates with respect to this latter system ; then
the coordinates of one particle at the instant ti, referred to the
original axes, will be given by the equations x = Xi cosh a + ct l sinh o, t t\ cosh a + Xi c~

where

axes, with reference to which the particles were moving with
velocity w, bears the ratio (1 -
w-/c'-)^ : 1 to their distance in the

system of measurement furnished by the transformed axes,with reference to which the particles are at rest. But according to FitzGerald's hypothesis of contraction, when a materialbody is in motion relative to the aether, in a direction parallelto the axis of x, its dimensions parallel to this directioncontract in precisely this ratio; so that the equation of thebody, in terms of the coordinates x}) y^ zly which movewithit, is unaltered. Thus the hypothesis of FitzGerald maybeexpressed by the statement .that the equations of the figuresof ponderable bodies are covariant with respect to those trans-formations for which the fundamental equations of the aetherare covariant. The covariance holds with respect to all linear homogeneoustransformations in the variables (x, y, z, t), of determinantunity, which transform the expression (x"

This group comprises an infinite number of transformations ; so that there are an infinite number of sets of variablesresembling (x}) ylt c,, ,), of which any one set (xr, yr , zr, tr) canbe derived from any other set (.rs, ys , zs, ts) by a transformationof the group ; among the sets we must of course includetheoriginal set of coordinates (x, y, z, t). But hitherto wehaveproceeded on the assumption that the original set (x, y, z, t)isentitled to a primacy among all the other sets, since the axes(x, y, z) have been supposed to possess the special propertyofhaving no motion relative to the aether, and the time repre-sented by the variable t has been understood to be a definitephysical quantity. The other sets of variables (.rr, yr, sr, tr)have been regarded merely as symbols convenient for useinproblems relating to moving bodies, but not as correspondingto physical entities in the same degree as (x, y, z, t). "Wemust now inquire whether this view is justified.
The question amounts to asking whether absolute positionin space, or at any rate absolute fixity relative to the aether,issomething which can be brought within the bounds of humanknowledge.
It is well known that the science of dynamics, as founded
Closing Years of the Nineteenth Century. 445
on Newton's laws of motion, does not supply any criterion by
which rest may be distinguished from uniform motion ; for if the laws of motion are applicable when the position of bodies
is referred to any particular set of axes, they will be equally
applicable when position is referred to any other set of axes which have a uniform motion of translation relative to these. The older theories of electrostatics, magnetism, and electro- dynamics, which are based on the conception of action at a
distance, are concerned only with relative configurations and
motions, and are therefore useless in the search for a basis of absolute reckoning.
But the existence of an aether, which is postulated in the
undulatory theory of light, seems at first sight to involve the
conceptions of rest and motion relative to it, and thus to afford a means of specifying absolute position. Suppose, for instance,
that a disturbance is generated at any point in free aether;
this disturbance will spread outwards in the form of a sphere ; and the centre of this sphere will for all subsequent time
occupy an unchanged position relative to the aether. In this way, or in many other ways, we might hope to determine, by
electrical or optical experiments, the velocity of the earth
relative to the aether. The failure of such experiments as had been tried led
Fitz Gerald* to suggest that the dimensions of material bodies
undergo contraction when the bodies are in motion relative to the aether. By the transformation of Lorentz and Larmor,
as we have seen, this hypothesis came to be expressed in a newform ; namely that the equation of the figure of the body,
referred to a frame of reference moving with it, is always the
same, but that frames of reference which are in motion relative to each other are based on different standards of length and time.
This way of regarding the matter brings into prominence the
fundamental questions involved. Before speaking of lengths
and velocities, it is necessary to examine the nature of systems
of measurement of space and time.

446 The Theory of Aether and Electrons in the
Of the events with which Natural Philosophy is concerned,each is perceived to happen at some definite location at somedefinite moment. When a material object has been observedto occupy a certain position at a certain instant, the sameobject may again be observed at a subsequent instant ; butitis impossible to determine whether the object is or is notinthe same position, since there is no obvious means of preservingthe identity of any location from one moment to another.The physicist, however, finds it convenient to constructaframework of axes in space and time for the purpose of fittinghis experiences into an orderly arrangement ; and the question at issue is whether experience furnishes the meansofdetermining a framework completely and uniquelybyabsolute properties, or whether the selection inevitably restson arbitrary choice and accidental circumstance.
In attempting to answer this question, it may first beobserved that the choice is always made so as to simplifythe description of natural phenomena as much as possible;thus, the variable which is to measure time is so chosen thatits increment in the interval between any two consecutivebeats of a pendulum is the same as its increment in the intervalbetween any other two consecutive beats. If the selectionofthe four variables (x, y, zy t) is well made, it should be possibleto express the laws of nature by statements of a simple character,e.g., that a body isolated from the influence of external agentsmoves through equal intervals of space in equal intervalsoftime.
Accepting, then, the principle that the framework of axesis to be chosen so as to furnish the simplest possible expressionof the natural laws, it becomes of importance to determinewhich of the natural laws are entitled, by reason of theirprimary importance, to receive the greatest consideration.Now many indications point to the probability that thevarious types of forces which are observed in ponderablebodies forces of cohesion, of chemical union, and so forthare ultimately electric in their nature. Such an assumption
Closing Years of the Nineteenth Century. 447would have the great advantage of explaining the contraction
postulated by Fitz Gerald, since it would represent the contraction as actually produced by the motion. But if this assumption be correct, the theory of electricity and aether is without doubt the fundamental theory of Natural Philosophy ; and the framework of space and time should be chosen with
a view chiefly to the expression of electrical phenomena. This
may most naturally be done by stipulating that the wavefronts of disturbances generated in free aether shall, in the
system of length and time adopted, be accounted spheres whosecentres are at the origins of disturbance and whose radii are
proportional to the times elapsed since their initiation. Eeferred
to axes of (#,y,z,) which satisfy these conditions, the fundamental
equations of the electric field assume the form which has been
taken as the basis of all our theoretical investigations.
Imagine now a distant star which is moving with a uniform
velocity w or c tanh a relative to this framework (x, y, z, t). Thetheorem of transformation shows that there exists another
framework (a?,, y\,z\, t^, with respect to which the star is at rest, and in which moreover the condition laid down regarding the
wave-surface is satisfied. This framework is peculiarly fitted for the representation of the phenomena which happen on the
star ; whose inhabitants would therefore naturally adopt it as
their system of space and time. Beings, on the other hand, whodwell on a body which is at rest with respect to the axes
(x, y, z, t) would prefer to use the latter system ; and from the
point of view of the universe at large, either of these systems
is as good as the other. The equations of motion of the aether
are the same with respect to both sets of coordinates, and
therefore neither can claim to possess the only property which
could confer a primacy namely, an absolute relation to the
aether.* To sum up, we may say that the phenomena whose study
is the object of Natural Philosophy take place each at a definite

location at a definite moment ; the whole constituting a four-dimensional world of space and time. To construct a setofaxes of space and time is equivalent to projecting this four-dimensional world into a three-dimensional world of space anda one-dimensional world of time ; and this projection maybeperformed in an infinite number of ways, each of whichisdistinguished from the others only by characteristics merelyarbitrary and accidental.* In order to represent natural phenomena without introducingthis contingent element, it would be necessary to abandonthecustomary three-dimensional system of coordinates, andtooperate in four dimensions. Analysis of this kind has beendevised, and has been applied to the theory of the aether;but its development belongs to the twentieth century, andconsequently falls outside the scope of the present work.From what has been said, it will be evident that, in theclosing years of the nineteenth century, electrical investigationwas chiefly concerned with systems in motion. The theoryofelectrons was, however, applied with success in other directions,and notably to the explanation of a new experimental discovery.The last recorded observation of Faradayf was an attemptto detect changes in the period, or in the state of polarization,of the light emitted by a sodium flame, when the flame wasplaced in a strong magnetic field. No result was obtained;but the conviction that an effect of this nature remained tobediscovered was felt by many of his successors. TaitJ examinedthe influence of a magnetic field on the selective absorptionoflight ; impelled thereto, as he explained, by theoretical considerations. For from the phenomenon of magnetic rotation it maybeinferred that rays circularly polarized in opposite senses arepropagated with different velocities in the magnetized medium; and therefore if only those rays are absorbed which havea* Cf.

certain definite wave-length in the medium, the period of the
ray absorbed from a beam of circularly polarized white light
will not be the same when the polarization is right-handed
as when it is left-handed. "Thus," wrote Tait, "what wasoriginally a single dark absorption-line might become a double
line."The effect anticipated under different forms by Faraday andTait was discovered, towards the end of 1896, by P. Zeeman.*
Eepeating Faraday's procedure, he placed a sodium flame
between the poles of an electromagnet, and observed a widening of the D-lines in the spectrum when the magnetizing
current was applied.
A theoretical explanation of the phenomenon was immediately furnished to Zeeman by Lorentz.f The radiation i& supposed to be emitted by electrons which describe orbits within the sodium atoms. If e denote the charge of an electron
of mass ra, the ponderomotive force which acts on it by virtue
of the external magnetic field is e [r . K], where K denotes the
magnetic force and r denotes the displacement of the electron from its position of equilibrium; and therefore, if the force which restrains the electron in its orbit be &, the equation of
motion of the electron is mi? -t- K
2r = e [f . K].
The motion of the electron may (as is shown in treatises on dynamics) be represented by the superposition of certain
particular solutions called principal oscillations, whose distin- guishing property is that they are periodic in the time. In order
to determine the principal oscillations, we write T^e
nt^- * for r, where r denotes a vector which is independent of the time, andn denotes the frequency of the principal oscillation : substituting in the equation, we have

This equation may be satisfied either (1) if r is parallel to K,in which case it reduces to

which gives for n the approximate values KW~* el/2m.
When there is no external magnetic field, so that K is zero,the three values of n which have been obtained all reducetoicw~V which represents the frequency of vibration of theemitted light before the magnetic field is applied. Whenthefield is applied, this single frequency is replaced by the threefrequencies cm~, cm"i + eK/2m, icm'i - eK/2m ; that is to say,the single line in the spectrum is replaced by three lines closetogether. The apparatus used by Zeeman in his earliest experiments was not of sufficient power to exhibit this triplicationdistinctly, and the effect was therefore described at first asawidening of the spectral lines.* We have seen above that the principal oscillation of theelectron corresponding to the frequency *cra~ is performed inadirection parallel to the magnetic force K. It will thereforegive rise to radiation resembling that of a Hertzian vibrator,and the electric vector of the radiation will be parallel to thelines of force of the external magnetic field. It follows thatwhen the light received in the spectroscope is that whichhasbeen emitted in a direction at right angles to the magneticfield, this constituent (which is represented by the middle lineof the triplet in the spectrum) will appear polarized in a planeat right angles to the field ; but when the light received in thespectroscope is that which has been emitted in the directionofthe magnetic force, this constituent will be absent.
We have also seen that the principal oscillations of theelectron corresponding to the frequencies Km-* eJ/2mare* Later observations, with more powerful apparatus, have shown that theprimitive spectral line is frequently replaced by more than three components.
Closing Years of the Nineteenth Century. 45 1 performed in a plane at right angles to the magnetic field K. In order to determine the nature of these two principal oscilla- tions, we observe that it is possible for the electron to describe a circular orbit in 'this plane, if the radius of the orbit be
suitably chosen ; for in a circular motion the forces *
2r and.-e[r . K] would be directed towards the centre of the circle ; andit would therefore be necessary only to adjust the radius so that
these furnish the exact amount of centripetal force required.
Such a motion, being periodic, would be a principal oscillation. Moreover, since the force e [r . K] changes sign when the sense of the movement in the circle is reversed, it is evident
that there are two such [circular orbits, corresponding to the
two senses in which the electron may circulate; these must,
therefore, be no other than the two principal oscillations of frequencies K.m~^ el/2m. When the light received in the
spectroscope is that which has been emitted in a direction at
right angles to the external magnetic field, the circles, are seen
edgewise, and the light appears polarized in a plane parallel to the field ; but when the light examined is that which has been
emitted in a direction parallel to the external magnetic force,
,the radiations of frequencies Km~i eK/2m are seen to be
circularly polarized in opposite senses. All these theoretical conclusions have been verified by observation.
It was found by Cornu* and by C. G-. W. Konigf that the more refrangible component (i.e., the one whose period is shorter
than that of the original radiation) has its circular vibration
in the same sense as the current in the electromagnet. Fromthis it may be inferred that the vibration must be due to a
resinously charged electron; for let the magnetizing current and the electron be supposed to circulate round the axis of z in the direction in which a right-handed screw must turn in order
to progress along the positive direction of the axis of z ; then
the magnetic force is directed positively along the axis of z, jand, in order that the force on the electron may be directed

inward to the axis of z (so as to shorten the period), the chargeon the electron must be negative.
The value of e/m for this negative electron may be determinedby measurement of the separation between the componentsofthe triplet in a magnetic field of known strength ; for, as wehave seen, the difference of the frequencies of the outer components is eKjm. The values of e/m thus determined agree wellwith the estimations* of e/m for the corpuscles of cathode rays.The phenomenon discovered by Zeeman is closely related tothe magnetic rotation of the plane of polarization of light.fBoth effects may be explained by supposing that the moleculesof material bodies contain electric systems which possessnatural periods of vibration, the simplest example of suchasystem being an electron which is attracted to a fixed centrewith a force proportional to the distance. Zeeman's effectrepresents the influence of an external magnetic field on thefree oscillations of these electric systems, while Faraday's effectrepresents the influence of the external magnetic field on theforced oscillations which the systems perform under the stimulusof incident light. The latter phenomenon may be analysedwithout difficulty on these principles, the equation of motionofone of the electrons being taken in the form
mr + K
2r = eE + e[r.H],
where m denotes the mass and e the charge of the electron,,r its distance from the centre of force, K
2 r the restitutive force,E and H the electric and magnetic forces. When the electronperforms forced oscillations under the influence of light offrequency n, this equation becomes
(K

The influence of the magnetic force on the motion of theelectron is small compared with the influence of the electricforce, i.e. the second term on the right is small compared withthe first term ; so in the second term we may replace r byits* Cf. p. 405. t Cf. pp. 213-216, 307-309, 367-370.

From the occurrence of the factor (KT - mw) in the denominator of the expression for the magneto-optic constant <r, itmay be inferred that the magnetic rotation will be very largefor light whose period is nearly the same as a free periodofvibration of the electrons. A large rotation is in fact observed*when plane-polarized light, whose frequency differs but littlefrom the frequencies of the D-lines. is passed through sodiumvapour in a direction parallel to the lines of magnetic force. The optical properties of metals may be explained, accordingto the theory of electrons, by a slight extension of the analysiswhich applies to the propagation of light in transparent substances. It is, in fact, only necessary to suppose that someofthe electrons in metals are free instead of being bound to themolecules : a supposition which may be embodied in the equationsby assuming that an electric force E gives rise to a polarization.P, where
E = aP + /3P + 7P ; the term in a represents the effect of the inertia of the electrons;the term in ]3 represents their ohmic drift ; and the terminyrepresents the effect of the restitutive forces where these exist.This equation is to be combined with the customary electro-magnetic equations

Voigt also predicted that if plane-polarized light, of period nearly tbe sameasthat of the D radiation, were passed through sodium vapour in a magnetic field,in a direction perpendicular to the lines of magnetic force, the velocity of propagation would be found to depend on the orientation of the plane of polarization,so that the sodium vapour would behave as a uniaxal crystal.

In the last years of the nineteenth century, attempts weremade to form more definite conceptions regarding the behaviourof electrons within metals. It will be remembered thattheoriginal theory of electrons had been proposed by WeberJforthe purpose of explaining the phenomena of electric currentsin metallic wires. Weber, however, made but little progresstowards an electric theory of metals ; for being concernedchiefly with magneto-electric induction and electromagneticponderomotive force, he scarcely brought the metal intothediscussion at all, except in the assumption that electronsofopposite signs travel with equal and opposite velocities relativeto its substance. The more comprehensive scheme of hissuccessors half a century afterwards aimed at connectingina unified theory all the known electrical properties of metals,such as the conduction of currents according to Ohm's law,thethermo-electric effects of Seebeck, Peltier, and W. Thomson,the galvano-magnetic effect of Hall, and other phenomena whichwill be mentioned subsequently.
The later investigators, indeed, ranged beyond the groupof purely electrical properties, and sought by aid of the theoryofelectrons to explain the conduction of heat. The principal groundon which this extension was justified was an experimental resultobtained in 1853 by G. Wiedemann and K. FranzJ whofound* Cf. p. 179. t Models illustrating the selective reflexion and absorption of light by metallicbodies and by gases were discussed by H. Lamb, Mem. and Proc. ManchesterLit..and Phil.

Closing Years of the Nineteenth Century. 457that at any temperature the ratio of the thermal conductivity
of a body to its ohmic conductivity is approximately the samefor all metals, and that the value of this ratio is proportional
to the absolute temperature. In fact, the conductivity of a pure metal for heat is almost independent of the temperature;
while the electric conductivity varies in inverse proportion to the absolute temperature, so that a pure metal as it approaches
the absolute zero of temperature tends to assume the character
of a perfect conductor. That the two conductivities are closely related was shown to be highly probable by the experimentsof Tait^ in which pieces of the same metal were found to exhibit
variations in ohmic conductivity exactly parallel to variations
in their thermal conductivity.
The attempt to explain the electrical and thermal properties
of metals by aid of the theory of electrons rests on the assumption that conduction in metals is more or less similar to conduction in electrolytes ; at any rate, that positive andnegative charges drift in opposite directions through the substance of the conductor under the influence of an electric
field. It was remarked in 1888 by J. J. Thomson,* who mustbe regarded as the founder of the modern theory, that the
differences which are perceived between metallic and electrolytic conduction may be referred to special features in the twocases, which do not affect their general resemblance. Inelectrolytes the carriers are provided only by the salt, whichis dispersed throughout a large inert mass of solvent ; whereasin metals it may be supposed that every molecule is capable
of furnishing carriers. Thomson, therefore, proposed to regard
the current in metals as a series of intermittent discharges,
caused by the rearrangement of the constituents of molecularsystems a conception similar to that by which Grothussf hadpictured conduction in electrolytes. This view would, as heshowed, lead to a general explanation of the connexion betweenthermal and electrical conductivities.

Most of the later writers on metallic conduction have preferred to take the hypothesis of Arrhenius* rather than thatofGrothuss as a pattern ; and have therefore supposed theinterstices between the molecules of the metal to be at alltimes swarming with electric charges in rapid motion. In1898 E. Eieckef effected an important advance by examiningthe consequences of the assumption that the average velocityofthis random motion of the charges is nearly proportional to thesquare root of the absolute temperature T. P. DrudeJ in 1900replaced this by the more definite assumption that the kineticenergy of each moving charge is equal to the average kineticenergy of a molecule of a perfect gas at the same temperature,and may therefore be expressed in the form qT, where q denotesa universal constant. In the same year J. J. Thomson remarked that it wouldaccord with the conclusions drawn from the study of ionizationin gases to suppose that the vitreous and resinous charges playdifferent parts in the process of conduction : the resinouscharges may be conceived of as carried by simple negativecorpuscles or electrons, such as constitute the cathode rays: they may be supposed to move about freely in the intersticesbetween the atoms of the metal. The vitreous charges, ontheother hand, may be regarded as more or less fixed in attachmentto the metallic atoms. According to this view the transportofelectricity is due almost entirely to the motion of the negativecharges.
An experiment which was performed at this time by Eiecke||lent some support to Thomson's hypothesis. A cylinderofaluminium was inserted between two cylinders of copperina circuit, and a current was passed for such a time that theamount of copper deposited in an electrolytic arrangement* Cf. p. 384. t G-ott.

The weight ofeach of the three cylinders, however, showed no measurablechange; from which it appeared unlikely that metallic con-duction is accompanied by the transport of metallic ions. The ideas of Thomson, Kiecke, and Drude were combined byLorentz* in an investigation which, as it is the most completer will here be given as the representative of all of them.
It is supposed that the atoms of the metal are fixed, andthat in the interstices between them a large number of resinous-electrons are in rapid motion. The mutual collisions of theelectrons are disregarded, so that their collisions with thefixed atoms alone come under consideration ; these areregarded as analogous to collisions between moving and fixedelastic spheres.
The flow of heat and electricity in the metal issupposed to take place in a direction parallel to the axis ofxt so that the metal is in the same condition at all points ofany plane perpendicular to this direction ; and the flow issupposed to be steady, so that the state of the system is independent of the time.
Consider a slab of thickness dx and of unit area ; and supposethat the number of electrons in this slab whose ^-componentsof velocity lie between u and u + du, whose ^-components ofvelocity lie between v and v + dv, and whose ^-components ofvelocity lie between w and w + dw, is / (ut v, w, x) dx du dv dw.
One of these electrons, supposing it to escape collision,will in the interval of time dt travel from (x, y, z) to (x + u dt,y + vdt, z + wdt) : and its ^-component of velocity will at theend of the interval be increased by an amount e Edtjm^ if ra ande denote its mass and charge, and E denotes the electric force.Suppose that the number of electrons lost to this group bycollisions in the interval dt is a dx du dv dw dt, and that the* Amsterdam Proceedings (English edition) vii (1904-1905), pp. 438, 585, 684

The simplest assumptionthat can be made regarding this term is that it is of the formu x a function of r only ; we shall, therefore, write

If it be assumed that the conduction of heat in metals is effected by motion of the electrons, this expression may becompared with the preceding; thus we have
and comparing this with the formula already found for theelectric conductivity, we have

' an equation which shows that the ratio of the thermal to theelectric conductivity is of the form T x a constant which is thesame for all metals. This result accords with the law of Wiedernann and Franz. Moreover, the value of q
is known from the kinetic theory of gases; and the value of e has been determined by J. J. Thomson*and his followers ; substituting these values in the formula for K/y, a fair agreement is obtained with the values of K/y determinedexperimentally.
It was remarked by J. J. Thomson that if, as is postulatedin the above theory, a metal contains a great number of free electrons in temperature equilibrium with the atoms, thespecific heat of the metal must depend largely on the energyrequired in order to raise the temperature of the electrons. Thomson considered that the observed specific heats of metalsare smaller than is compatible with the theory, and was thus* Cf. p. 407.

led to investigate* the consequences of his original hypothesis^regarding the motion of the electrons, which differs from theone just described in much the same way as Grothuss' theory.ofelectrolysis differs from Arrhenius'. Each electron was nowsupposed to be free only for a very short time, from the momentwhen it is liberated by the dissociation of an atom to the momentwhen it collides with, and is absorbed by, a different atom. Theatoms were conceived to be paired in doublets, one pole of eachdoublet being negatively, and the other positively, electrified.Under the influence of an external electric field the doubletsorient themselves parallel to the electric force, and the electronswhich are ejected from their negative poles give rise to a currentpredominantly in this direction. The electric conductivity ofthe metal may thus be calculated. In order to c
